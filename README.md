# soccer-sentiment-analysis
Scraping soccer forums to predict in game events based on sentiment.

Ongoing project.

Stages: 
- Scrape data from [https://roysviewfrom.com](Roys View) using Beautiful Soup (Complete).
- Scrape data of football statistics from FBref (complete)
- Clean data 
- Analyze the sentiment of the comments (complete)
- Preprocess the data
- Analyse data to determine which predictive models are appropriate (avoiding just throwing the data at models and seeing what sticks)
- Use the models with the data to see whether predictions can be made
- Visualize the results


# Results
An initial run of the data suggests that the sentiment of the comments can be used to predict losses more accurately than wins.  


This work is based on a project undertaken as part of CS-5245 Data programming taught by Dr. Parry.
