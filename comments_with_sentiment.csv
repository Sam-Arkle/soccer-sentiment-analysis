Duchatelet has clearly signalled his intention to carrying on interfering in playing matters, which is bound to undermine whoever he appoints sooner rather than later.“We are resigned to the fact that whoever is appointed will be dismissed before very long and the whole cycle will start again. There is no reason for anyone to believe otherwise. Therefore, our focus remains on removing Duchatelet and his puppets.”Previously, CARD has interrupted four matches at The Valley just after kick-off. The team has gone on to win three of them – against Middlesbrough and Birmingham City last season and Coventry City in October. Charlton were already relegated when they took on promotion-chasing Brighton & Hove Albion in the fourth, last April.CARD’s matchday activity was suspended at the start of the season to allow the new management team and squad an opportunity to show things had changed, but no similar luxury will be afforded former MK Dons boss Karl Robinson, who is set to become the latest to take the ejector seat at The Valley.The spokesperson said: “Despite all the warm words from chief executive Katrien Meire when Russell Slade was appointed during the summer, repeated to a national radio audience less than a month ago, the regime’s true colours still come shining through.“Whether it’s the unqualified Thomas Driesen scouting players by computer, the network stooge Chris O’Loughlin being placed at the training ground to report back to Belgium or pressure from Duchatelet himself, the manager will always be undermined. Nothing has changed and nothing will change while the club is owned and run by these people.”Last week, CARD took its protests to Belgium using a London taxi in a special Charlton protest livery and it plans further activity away from matchdays to embarrass Duchatelet and Meire among their peers.”",Neutral,0.5787360072135925

They are all to similar kind of player all energy and work rate.

Clumsy Claude Davis was also very lucky not to have conceded at least one penalty.We went in at half time a goal down having barely had a touch of the ball.Legend has it that manager Steve Evans actually apologised to his players for getting his tactics all wrong, and sent them back out with some fire in their bellies and sure enough we were a different team in the second half, putting in a proper Rotherham United display of gritty determination coupled with a touch of class here and there. Kieren Agard, almost anonymous up to this point, smashed in an equaliser from somewhere up on Sheffield Road.

Our next game is already on tuesday night as we go to fellow play off contenders Sheffield United in the first of a number of “6 pointers”. United lost their last game 2-3 away at Barnsley despite leading 2-1 with 25 minutes to go. United are in bad shape at the moment and have only won 1 game in 7 which was at home againt the mighty Burton 5 games ago. They are trailing Boro by 4 points so the onus is on them to attack us. That might free up some space for Traore, Downing, Howson and Bamford on the break which is likely the tactics Pulis will employ.They seem a bit nervous about the game knowing that a loss or maybe even a draw could end their season. They know they are not in great form and their defence isn’t getting much praise. If the players are thinking along those lines too I predict a very tactical game and probably only one goal in it. We really need to get at them and not let their confidence grow. They are in a bad shape and we need to rattle them from kick off.”",Negative,0.6610147953033447

Which is somewhat true. But it has gone a bit under the radar that they have spent a reasonably amount of money since coming up. They spent 64m last season, and 56m according to Transfermarkt. That’s with very little recouped in sold players. In the same period we have bought 52m and 35.2m respectively, and received 24.5m and 23.6m. Of course, we have built up a more developed squad over a number of seasons, and that the money that they have spent is still little compared to most other sides. But I think it would surprise people how much they have spent and a 1 point return is pretty dreadful for that outlay. I think we will win this one. We have scored in all EPL games this season except the opening game and have scored 2 goals in a match 8 times. Ings back, Che looks the business, JWP freekick threat, and even Vestegaard threat off set pieces and I think we should be okay scoring a couple. I look at Sheffield United’s attack and think, will they score 1, let alone 2 against us? Probably not in all honesty unless the defense does something dumb (Bednarek I’m looking at one of your little air swings). Especially if Vestegaard plays like how he did Monday night.

As a result, I have a unique insight into the psyche of the average blade and so here’s their standard excuses for when they get beat:1. They would have beaten us if they’d had their first choice midfield available. Whenever they lose it’s always down to them being one or more short in midfield. Admittedly, this argument is going to be more difficult to pull-off now they’ve signed a few. Their first choice midfield are: coutts, some bloke who isn’t coutts, another bloke who isn’t coutts, and another bloke who I’ve never heard of but definitely isn’t as good as coutts. By the way coutts is the best player in the championship and is highly rated by all SU fans. P.S. Coutts suffered a broken leg in a match against Burton literally ages ago but this doesn’t stop SU fans constantly harping on about him. As an update, SU fans are currently petitioning the EFL to get Burton’s villain of the piece banned for life despite the fact that said villain merely attempted to block coutts’ shot and the referee didn’t see the challenge as a foul never mind a booking.2. Their entire squad, training ground, & stadium, cost less than Neves. They’re very fond of proclaiming that they have the smallest budget in the championship (except they don’t) and will be quick to point this out when they get stuffed. There’s nothing at all ironic in this position despite the fact that they bought promotion from league 1 with the largest budget of all competing clubs and posted a thumping £6 million loss last year. As an aside, Neves isn’t fit to lace Coutts’ boots.3. Undoubtedly our win will be down to us scoring a worldy. Whenever SU lose it’s because the opposition either: a) score a worldy; b) played out of their skins, e.g. Fulham; c) got lucky, as in, Fulham scored 5 lucky goals.4. SU got a player undeservedly sent off. As in, since when did a two footed studs up leg breaking lunge 1ft off the ground warrant a red card??? Flecks’ perfectly legitimate well timed tackle was deemed worthy of a red by the overly officious referee of their encounter with Bristol City. Korey Smith, the villain of the piece for successfully influencing the referee due to his theatrics, stupidly took things way too far by actually going off injured. Yes, he went off injured and the knuckle draggers still say he was a play acting wimp. Football is now played by pansies. BC went on to beat SU but only because Fleck was undeservedly sent off and BC got extremely lucky. BC definitely didn’t deserve to win and Wilder definitely didn’t **** things up with his tactics and substitutions. P.S. Wilder is God since achieving promotion from league 1 despite his hands being tied and forced to work miracles with the largest budget in the division.5.

Is it because our defence has to be propped up and this stops our supply to them, or is it our midfield who are letting both the defence and the strikers down.

I think this is happening at the Blunts.”“I’m itching to back the Blunts big style to win this. But they haven’t won once in their last four games, and 6/4 looks too short. Equally, we look a bit too big to lay.We’ve no White (injured), Long (suspended) or Scowen (injured). So it’s Fred Karno’s circus at the back, and a lack of bite in midfield.

Without them united have very little width from what I’ve seen of them, so Robinson and Barkhuizen on the wings is a must in my opinion, with Bodin either benched or played centrally.  O’Connell, Basham, and Stearman are all around 6’3″ so we’ll have no luck with the long balls forward we resort to at times, so keeping the ball on the ground is an absolute must as I doubt we’ll win many duels.

They are similar to us with their system being the key in general over the individual.But the loss of Dean Henderson is huge imo, he was vital to their form last season given they dont score much (only scored more than one goal in 8 or 9 league games i think).Not saying Henderson is solely responsible but without him it would have been a relegation battle for Blades imo.Now they have an inferior replacement and they still arent scoring.They are desperate for attackers imo, any side that relies on ageing lower league strikers like Sharp and McGoldrick plus McBurnie who hasnt looked up to it in the Prem so far will struggle for goals.Given there success was built on a fantastic young goalie and a well organised side (credit Wilder for that) i think they will find this season much harder.2nd season is always harder, they dont have the momentum of promotion and they are still relying on the system over individuals which is fine but they needed an exceptional individual last season and they dont have him now.Suppose the question is can the very clever Chris Wilder system cover for the loss of a very talented individual?Imo as things stand it will be very difficult, with 2 or 3 quality signings especially in the attacking positions though then very possibly.Blades are a well organised side defensively, we are very solid offensively.They dont score we cant stop conceding.”",Neutral,0.48166918754577637

Especially Trippier on the right side, his runs, his calls and his delivery are always perfect. He was unknown before his arrival in the Tottenham squad but today, he’s one of the best offensive right back.Plus the Tottenham connection is hugely present in this team and we must to contain that, not let them to play and take confidence between them. With players like Alli, Dier, Kane, Trippier, Rose, or with Walker who was at Tottenham too.So Southgate will maybe play with the same line-up as he did in their past matchs during this world cup, with Pickford – Maguire, Stones, Walker – Young, Henderson, Alli, Lingard, Trippier – Kane, Sterling.With Delph, Rashford and Dier as replacement for Young, Sterling and Henderson.But yeah, as you said their set pieces are really dangerous and they’re all coming from Trippier.Now, this will be a real test for us because by the past, we had always some problems to play against this type of line-up (look at Mexico, who is playing the 3-5-2 too). And here the stamina aspect is at my eyes really important if we want to counter them because their players are fully fit and really fast with and without the ball. (Offensively and defensively).The key will be to see our midfield join the attack and not let our 3 strikers alone up front. We’ll need to play as a block and counter them as an unit. The croatian legs will be really heavy but this is our only chance to take a result from this match.Plus Harry Kane is actually my favorite player out of our NT, and we need to be really worried about him because we can’t let him 2cm front of him. This guy is clearly a lethal weapon and he is able to score with both foot, header, make the call, the right passes for his lads etc…This will be really tough for me to see our NT playing against some players from my favorite team who is Tottenham…”",Positive,0.49973729252815247

They’ve struggled for years under the burden of that pressure and their media is awful to them.This is a VERY talented young English team and their youth and inexperience seems to have shielded them from the gloom that marked recent sides – but they are still kids and they play very aggressively. So far they’ve played two of the weakest teams in the tournament and then sat their stars when they had to play a real threat in Belgium. They are getting attacked by their own press as cowards – who knows how that effects them.The first 15 Ms of the game will be vital.

On the main City forum I found this amusing description of a recent home defeat to Fleetwood. “In short, we were garbage. Second best from start to finish. I went home angry Saturday at bad defending and missed chances. Our defence was poor again with errors for the goals and other chances but we created sod all tonight. We were well beaten and they totally deserved to win. I cannot think of one player who won their individual battle and no one can come off saying they played well. We were well beaten by a committed and organised side who worked us out from the off and won the game at a canter. The thing that galled me was not the mistakes or the poor, pedestrian and predictable, totally non-penetrating football, but the lack of effort and not winning battles. The team did not look arsed tonight. That is a worry for a side top of the league. Hope it is a one off and we can get back to it in a few weeks but 4 or 5 will be fearing for their places after a total non-performance. Everything we have done well this season, good attitude, pressing, hassling and winning first and second balls, we failed to do. They were well organised, hungry and exposed our weaknesses. There were 5 clear chances in the game and they had them all. Sharp had a few half chances; mostly made himself but I cannot recall a really good chance we made all game. Granted most of their chances came from abysmal defending. It was really worrying how the heads dropped and we have gone in a few weeks from a confident side that suddenly players cannot wait to get rid of the ball and move it on.

Since then they’ve played 6 League One games and won them all, and no doubt there will be an element of wanting to set the record straight when they come to the Banks’s on Saturday (it should also be remembered that we beat them 1-2 at Bramall Lane in October in the tin pot trophy). Their recent form has resulted in occupation of the top-of-the-table spot, 4 points clear of Scunthorpe United. According to the form book we don’t have a chance of even a point out of this one, but that’s also what the form book said about the two previous encounters. Not only are the Blades top of the table, they’re also very nearly top scorers in League One with an impressive 50 goals so far (compare that to our 26), and their defence has been boosted by on-loan Dingle Ethan Ebanks-Landell staying at Bramall lane until May – he also scored last week against Southend so is evidently one to watch. Unsurprisingly the Blades’ equivalent of UTS (S24SU) in their regular poll of game predictions overwhelmingly forecast an away win, although 8% of contributors actually reckoned we would score 2 goals!! No matter what JW tweaks for this one I can’t honestly see us getting 3 points out of it – I’ll be quite happy with a draw thank you very much. Whitney has been talking Simeon Jackson up this week (“the goals will come”) but for me a key decision will be whether he sees sense and plays Oztumer from the start. The extension of Jason McCarthy’s loan until the end of the season was good news, and presumably the week’s break for the squad will mean that any minor niggling injuries will have been cleared up. Matt Preston will be pushing for a start, and at the time of writing the situation regarding Scott Laird is still unclear”",Positive,0.5383532643318176

How different it might have been if this game had been scheduled for the start of the season – United lost three of their first four games and were firmly rooted to the foot of the table, but since then Chris Wilder seems to have found the magic touch and his Blades are currently undefeated in their last 15 League One games.

He was rested for the FA Cup game against Leyton Orient, and United still managed to win 6-0 !!! Additional motivation (if it were needed) for United would be for them to show us what they can really do after we put them out of the Checkatrade Trophy.So, will it be “more of the same” from Jon Whitney? He is surely finding out what does, and does not, “gel” in his squad by now – and in this game more than most he is going to have to be extremely well prepared in terms of selection and tactics. Anything less could see a repeat of the Rochdale result because Sheffield United are no mugs (not at the moment, anyway, on a 15 game unbeaten run). We have scored 3 goals in our last 5 League One games and although it’s easy enough to say “play 2 up front” to increase the chances of scoring, would that result in a weakening of our defensive capabilities specially against the free-scoring opposition at Bramall Lane? Bakayoko surely deserves a chance at 90 minutes – after all, he knows where the net is on this ground, and perhaps with a partnership of Jackson or Makris (fed by Turkish Messi) we might have a look-in….. “",Neutral,0.5821223855018616

It was thought that his time should have been spent solely as manager, without the distraction of being physio.

The fact a sizable minority of fans would rather us fail with Davis rather than change and see what happens sums up the pathetic mentality of some of our fans.

Sure eventually a really big club will come in for Jimmy and he will go, he is destined for the top, of that I have absolutely no doubt.

He picked his chairman, how the club is run and the vast community projects run by the clubs community trust plus the family values the club stands for all were a good match for Jimmy’s values and principals.Regarding this season, I never ever thought we could reach the championship, of course its very early days yet but we are top and maybe the unthinkable is possible. I have seen nothing to frighten us football wise, other clubs in this division maybe have some better quality players than we do but we have an organised team and a game plan masterminded by JFH and David Oldfield, we have belief, ambition and superb team spirit allied to a lot of ability.We may well fall flat on our face at some stage but I seriously doubt it, the club are going to give it everything we have got, I like what the players say, ” we aren’t playing the size of the club, its history or supporters but the 11 players on the pitch representing that club”.For a supporter like me with nearly 50 seasons under his belt its dreamland at present, I am going to enjoy the ride home and away and see where it takes us.”",Positive,0.5100295543670654
