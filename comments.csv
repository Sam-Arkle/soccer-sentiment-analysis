Pre-Match View From Leeds,https://roysviewfrom.com/2025/02/23/pre-match-view-from-leeds-7/,2025-02-23,“The Blunts can’t play us like they did at our place their fans won’t let him. They will come out and have a go in a full blood and thunder derby. He will be telling them try anything they can to get an advantage. Dunno why but im expecting a very high tempo on the cuff “dirty” game. This is to top the table I was more nervous with Sunderland at home than I am with the Blunts. They are grinding out the results fair play to them but they aint looking box office and have been riding their luck. still it isn’t going to be easy they have plenty of talent to turn a game but hand on heart if we turn up they going to need a major lift in performance. but a Derby could just do that. I want a win and think we are rightly fav’s but I’s take a draw also and move onto the next.”

Pre-Match View From Leeds,https://roysviewfrom.com/2025/02/23/pre-match-view-from-leeds-7/,2025-02-23,“The way we played 1st hour against Sunderland was very nervy. At the final whistle they were jumping and dancing around like they had won the league. I didn’t like it one bit. I get that it was a big goal in the last minute but the celebrations should have been done behind closed doors.I’ve not said much this week because I get that we are all on a high but the way we reacted to Mondays win was one of relief which shows that we were worried about it beforehand. I’d have much rather it had been “just another win” type of reaction. Even the huddle on the pitch was a little bit cringe.I took Monday nights performance and subsequent over celebrations as a sign of the pressure being felt at the club and certainly with the players.Its the first sign of a mental wobble and we all remember what happened last season. I didn’t like it.Just throwing it out there.”

Monday becomes more important because if we can create a gap between us and Sheffield United, it hugely increases our top 2 chances. We can’t lose on Monday because it lets Burnley back in”"

Edwards was signed in Jan and he’s a difference maker. That’s why Jan can make it break your season, took a gamble.”"
Pre-Match View From Leeds,https://roysviewfrom.com/2025/02/23/pre-match-view-from-leeds-7/,2025-02-23,"“Their own fans are saying it.Burnley fans have hated their style of play so far this season and Blades fans don’t understand how they’ve won so many games, especially lately.”"

Pre-Match View From Leeds,https://roysviewfrom.com/2025/02/23/pre-match-view-from-leeds-7/,2025-02-23,“I get he wasn’t good defensively in the prem but the fact Sheff Utd fans push this season that Bogle still can’t defend is really quite bitter. He’s been absolutely elite at both ends of the field for us this season bar maybe 1st game of the season. He’s a joke of a player”
Pre-Match View From Leeds,https://roysviewfrom.com/2025/02/23/pre-match-view-from-leeds-7/,2025-02-23,“Wait for all the Sheffield fans saying he can’t defend  one of our best players in a very expensive and decent squad.”

Pre-Match View From Luton,https://roysviewfrom.com/2025/02/14/pre-match-view-from-luton-7/,2025-02-14,“How are we 35 and 40 behind Burnley and Sheff U when we finished above them in the prem?Expected to be behind them but the margin is stunning.”

Pre-Match View From Luton,https://roysviewfrom.com/2025/02/14/pre-match-view-from-luton-7/,2025-02-14,"“Luton do have 15 games left and 45 points to play for to try and secure their Championship status, but they still have to face Sheffield United, Burnley and Leeds, meaning based on the evidence of the season so far, it’s more like 12 matches remaining to stay up.”"

Pre-Match View From Luton,https://roysviewfrom.com/2025/02/14/pre-match-view-from-luton-7/,2025-02-14,“We will lose against Sheffield and Plymouth.”
Pre-Match View From Luton,https://roysviewfrom.com/2025/02/14/pre-match-view-from-luton-7/,2025-02-14,"“Sheff Utd play 4231 and are strong in wide areas, like Sunderland.Do we match up their formation? 1 up front certainly isn’t working but if we return to 352 do we want Andersen being pulled out the flanks to deal with Rak Sakyi or Harmer? And we’ve signed lots of wide players. Could go 442 but the solution to being awful in midfield doesn’t seem to be to take another body out of midfield. I’m at the point now where I basically think nothing is likely to work.”"
Pre-Match View From Luton,https://roysviewfrom.com/2025/02/14/pre-match-view-from-luton-7/,2025-02-14,“Let’s just hope the fans don’t resort to abusing the board and players as that doesn’t achieve anything.

Didnt see anything from their game v Pompey to be worried, but then again I could say that about usI actually fancy Burnley to bore us al to 2nd place”"

Pre-Match View From Middlesbrough,https://roysviewfrom.com/2025/02/11/pre-match-view-from-middlesbrough-3/,2025-02-11,"“Sheff Utd last 2 home games, they’ve been well and truly outplayed.Against Portsmouth on Saturday, they should’ve been 2 down before they went 1-0 up. And even after they scored, they were outplayed and should’ve failed to pick up 3pts.And against Hull prior to this, they got well and truly schooled.I’m not scared of Sheff Utd. I know they’re 2nd, but I think that’s because the league this season is extremely weak in comparison to previous years and they’ve had some luck on the way with some favourable results.The biggest worry I have, is not Sheff Utd, but us and our defence.”"

It’s the worst timing possible for us given poor form and playing away at a side in good form, at a ground where our record is poor”"
Pre-Match View From Middlesbrough,https://roysviewfrom.com/2025/02/11/pre-match-view-from-middlesbrough-3/,2025-02-11,"“Given Sheffield’s form has generally been far more consistent and they will be on home turf, I really can’t see Boro getting anything from this. I can see us maybe nicking a goal against the run of play, or just catching them cold early on, but given the horrendous state of our defence, if the hosts are on anything close to their best form, we will have a torrid time. Boro have scored 9 times in their last 10 visits to Bramall Lane, but conceded 16. Reckon the gap will be a bit wider after Wednesday. Fully expect us to concede a minimum of 3 goals.”"
Pre-Match View From Middlesbrough,https://roysviewfrom.com/2025/02/11/pre-match-view-from-middlesbrough-3/,2025-02-11,“Ah man. Please don’t let us get pumped by Sunderland and then Wilder in the space of 10 days. Don’t think I could take it.”

One thread even predicts a 5-0 battering off us.Yet we’d all swap their position for ours wouldn’t we?”
Pre-Match View From Middlesbrough,https://roysviewfrom.com/2025/02/11/pre-match-view-from-middlesbrough-3/,2025-02-11,"“Sunderland and Burnley fans the same.This is why I’m desperate for Carrick to crack it, for all the faults defensively we’ve been a good watch under him. And it’s not like we’re only good to watch because we’re carelessly just throwing loads of bodies forward.It should be possible to play our style of football and defend better. Most of the goals stem from individual errors.In possession we’re a very well coached side. Out of possession were often very poor. But to quote another thread it does feel like we’re really not far away. Which probably adds to the frustration for a lot of fans.”"
Pre-Match View From Middlesbrough,https://roysviewfrom.com/2025/02/11/pre-match-view-from-middlesbrough-3/,2025-02-11,“We set our team up to overload the opposition.. we are creating a machine of extreme overloads.. you have to work tremendously hard to make these extremes work.. which they will.. but you can’t just decide to do them every now and then.It does feel like a kick in the teeth when we are taken apart by a simple dink over the top and a cracking long range effort.. but we’re playing it by the numbers. “

We’re actually consistently good or bad depending on whether we have the majority of the ball or not. If we let the other team have the ball and play on the counter with a defensive structure we’re actually really good. If the other team let us have the ball and force us to attack, we’re terrible.I can’t see any way to look through our results when we have 50%+ of possession or not but we have tended to do best this season when we concede possession from the get-go. So, playing away at Sheff Utd the one thing we know is that they will demand the ball and we will set out defensively.For this reason, I wouldn’t be surprised at all to see us get a decent result there”"
Pre-Match View From Middlesbrough,https://roysviewfrom.com/2025/02/11/pre-match-view-from-middlesbrough-3/,2025-02-11,"“That’s not really true as results are mixed. For example when we beat Sheff Utd earlier in the season we had more possession than them. Sheff Utd don’t have a particularly high possession percentage – they are 10th overall in the Championship, and 9th at home. We average more possession away from home than they average at home. We have the 4th highest average in the Championship and we actually average more possession away from home than we average at home as well, which is unusual tbh, I can’t see another team in the Championship who does the same. Our issues aren’t about having the ball or not having the ball, it’s more about the mistakes we make with and without the ball. It’s also a rather annoying fact that we have the second most shots per game in the Championship, and we concede the second fewest shots per game as well – we are level with Burnley who have the best defensive record in the league.”"

Our most expensive signing in the current squad was around £4m until last week, now £6m. We clearly needed a left back in August, but had very limited funds and that position has proved leaky this season. Right back we took on a free transfer again I suspect because of limited funds. Our most expensive defender/keeper has cost £1m? it felt like we had the raid the piggy bank to get Edmundson for a mighty £500k?our xG is top 2.

He’s an old-fashioned manager who is a dying breed.Appleton is tomorrow’s man. And if he learns – what, he must be 5 years behind CW in developement as a young manager – how to mix up styles of play and tactics (eg Wimbledon) and basically do the old-fashioned stuff more, I’m pretty convinvced he will manage in the PL.”"
Pre-Match View From Oxford,https://roysviewfrom.com/2017/03/06/pre-match-view-from-oxford-2/,2017-03-06,"“I do think that the way Northampton play and have had success with thanks to Wilder is similar to how we played in 2013/14, playing physical and very effective defensive football, scoring on the counter. I couldn’t say for Sheffield United this season but it wouldn’t surprise me if they play similarly.”"
Pre-Match View From Oxford,https://roysviewfrom.com/2017/03/06/pre-match-view-from-oxford-2/,2017-03-06,"“The stats they tell exactly the same story for Wilder. Northampton created very few chances all season (compared to the best team in the division….and several others). They were just extremely clinical. And the wheels never fell off, rather they kept it up all year![not true this year, though – stats would suggest that Sheffield United are a genuinely top team is all respects]As far as we’re concerned…..the stats would suggest that we’re playing really well at both ends of the pitch. If we were a bit more clinical and, dare we say it, a bit luckier – we’d be in the promotion hunt.”"
Pre-Match View From Oxford,https://roysviewfrom.com/2017/03/06/pre-match-view-from-oxford-2/,2017-03-06,“Fair play to him. Northampton werent the biggest team and he got them promoted. Sheff Utd though are arguably one of the top 3 sides in our league and anything less than promotion will be a failure. If he gets them in the top 8 of the Championship then he can be regarded as a good manager.”

Pre-Match View From Oxford,https://roysviewfrom.com/2017/03/06/pre-match-view-from-oxford-2/,2017-03-06,"“It was widely reported that Sheff Utd had the biggest budget in the league last season, 3 times the average for League one. They were paying an average of nearly 5,000 pounds per week. Yes they brought in around 4 million with the sales of Adams and Calvert-Lewin, but appear to have the same 25 man sized squad from last season.Their average attendance would put them in the top half of attendances in the Championship. But being in the Championship I would hasten to guess their average attendance would be around the 25,000 mark.If they get promoted, we will see how good a manager he is.”"

That has resulted in teams declining the invitation to press them high.I think (if Cullen is fit) we press them with Cooper and Cullen plus a wide player – but once the press looks unsuccessful we retreat to a lower block with the personnel still goal side.My concern is that Key and (an even bigger culprit) Tymon get attracted to the press like moths to the flame – and then we will see the space in behind them attacked ruthlessly and at high pace.The key (pardon the pun) will be the discipline of our wing backs and Grimes and Franco.

They’re playing hamer as a left winger who naturally drifts into the centre and pushes Burrows up the pitch where we’d need Nyambe to deal with him.In possession they will essentially have four central midfielders so we will need 3 centre mids to match up with them aswell as pulling our left winger in to sit on Arblaster who’s usually the anchor in midfield. They’ve Gilchrist at right back who’s very similar to Nyambe as a full back, defensively sound and doesn’t wander forward too often, which leaves them with a back three essentially when on the ball.We could leave Yates to find space with Jackson to run off him as he can attack the space Burrows leaves when he gets forward. We will have to work very hard but on the counter Yates and Jackson should find time and space in pockets on both wings where they’re most effective.Ebou will need to hold onto O’Hare all game and Elder will have to have one hell of a game against Rak-Sakyi, apart from those two we won’t have to man a mark any players but will have to work very hard to try keep clean sheet or get a result. “"

It’s one we could get thrashed in, stay competitive in or even win. Either of those is a possibility. If you asked most Watford fans for a prediction they would take a point. It would keep us unbeaten and having ten points from the first four league games is still very impressive and probably at least five more than we thought we would have pre season. Sheff Utd are a better Championship side than a PL side but they are not invincible either. QPR came back from 2-0 down so they have errors in them as well as wealth of attacking options.I think with the confidence of the squad going into it we can withstand their press and take a well earned point.”"

Pre-Match View From Charlton,https://roysviewfrom.com/2016/11/25/pre-match-view-from-charlton/,2016-11-25,"“There will be no suspension of protests at Charlton this weekend, regardless of the expected managerial change, the Coalition Against Roland Duchatelet (CARD) has confirmed.CARD has major plans for Saturday’s home game against Sheffield United.It is calling on its army of volunteers to make a special effort to turn out and Charlton fans in general to make clear they are not taken in by this latest instalment of Groundhog Day.A spokesperson said: “This will be the seventh ‘fresh start’ the regime has declared in under three years, and this one comes with the pre-announced installation of a Duchatelet network spy on the coaching staff, Chris O’Loughlin.“At this stage the man who nominally takes charge of the team is barely relevant. Duchatelet has clearly signalled his intention to carrying on interfering in playing matters, which is bound to undermine whoever he appoints sooner rather than later.“We are resigned to the fact that whoever is appointed will be dismissed before very long and the whole cycle will start again. There is no reason for anyone to believe otherwise. Therefore, our focus remains on removing Duchatelet and his puppets.”Previously, CARD has interrupted four matches at The Valley just after kick-off. The team has gone on to win three of them – against Middlesbrough and Birmingham City last season and Coventry City in October. Charlton were already relegated when they took on promotion-chasing Brighton & Hove Albion in the fourth, last April.CARD’s matchday activity was suspended at the start of the season to allow the new management team and squad an opportunity to show things had changed, but no similar luxury will be afforded former MK Dons boss Karl Robinson, who is set to become the latest to take the ejector seat at The Valley.The spokesperson said: “Despite all the warm words from chief executive Katrien Meire when Russell Slade was appointed during the summer, repeated to a national radio audience less than a month ago, the regime’s true colours still come shining through.“Whether it’s the unqualified Thomas Driesen scouting players by computer, the network stooge Chris O’Loughlin being placed at the training ground to report back to Belgium or pressure from Duchatelet himself, the manager will always be undermined. Nothing has changed and nothing will change while the club is owned and run by these people.”Last week, CARD took its protests to Belgium using a London taxi in a special Charlton protest livery and it plans further activity away from matchdays to embarrass Duchatelet and Meire among their peers.”"
Pre-Match View From Charlton,https://roysviewfrom.com/2016/11/25/pre-match-view-from-charlton/,2016-11-25,"“If anything is being thrown on the pitch could it be staggered. 3 or 4 hold ups to the game will have far more impact than one 90 second one.

Pre-Match View From Charlton,https://roysviewfrom.com/2016/11/25/pre-match-view-from-charlton/,2016-11-25,"“I’m not in favour of holding up play as I have said before. If it is going to happen, its going to happen, but if it is going to happen 3-4 times, you run the risk of those that are tolerating the hold ups being completely alienated from the match day active anti regime and yes you can want to watch a football match and still be anti regime.It was reported that there was dissent at the last game in the crowd, how do you think it will look if some of our fans start fighting because of the continued stoppages .. it will look like Millwall.The single stoppage makes the point and does not fracture the fan base, multiple stoppages, a points deduction will fracture the fans base. For or against the regime, I would hope everybody on this board want the fans to be as one when this lot go!”"

However, our team is not too shabby when given freedom to play as we’ve shown in our last two games; Magennis will never stop running, Ajose has finally found his feet and in Ademola Lookman we have one of the few players in the division who can provide a real flash of absolute quality. Our defence is very solid. The thing about Sheffield United is they like to have a lot of shots; Dillon Phillips will have to be on his toes if called upon again. Would be very harsh to change the team from Tuesday but I reckon Nugent may bring Jacko back in, a calm head on the field for what is likely to be a high charged match.

Already the Blades have beaten Derby, Sheff Wed & Wolves so they can play and are a real threat at home. Watching the Wednesday game gave me the chance to get a first sight of a certain young kid called David Brooks, man what a player this boy is going to be, he ran the show and is destined to be a real star of the future, we think we have some good kids coming through but Brooks is hot property already in my eyes, at 20 years old I am surprised I don’t know more about him but this attacking Midfielder or wide player is a joy to watch, lets hope he has a stinker on Saturday. This is another new ground for me and I am looking forward to it although I would urge any Town fans making the journey to be careful, Two or Three times already this season there has been trouble at their games, Norwich fans were attacked as they left the stadium following their win, the Sheffield Utd fans just stormed into the away end as the were leaving resulting in some being hospitalised and then there was the fighting at Boro where kids got injured so we all need to be on our guard, especially if things do go our way. “"

Unlikely. Sure, we’ve put back to back wins together ( both on the road ) with our first W W sequence since beating Forest + Derby.5 unbeaten away is fantastic. Home is more the issue – given how we play, we’re better set up to play on the road. That’s ultimately where I think this is going to end – I don’t see us winning three on the spin.

We have to fight every inch of the way in the same manner we did against Spurs.”“We have to remember tactics will be different. Spurs came to the Cottage full of confidence and played an open game looking for goals.Shef.U. will play a very tight game intent in leaving no space for us to play in.We seem to get better results against team playing the open game. ““About time we turned around our fortunes away from home. Sheffield and Forest away coming out of the international break then a home game against a struggling Newcastle. We can make a charge up the table. ““if we can score early on, they will have no option but to attack and can see us hammering them. Although they haven’t been great at “parking the bus” for them a draw probably isn’t enough if they want to save face, although not mathematically relegated, its only a matter of time”“Sheffield United struggle with possession and shots on target from the little of what I have seen from them. If we put in a performance like we did against Spurs with fast flowing football, there is no reason we can’t be hitting 5 against them like several other clubs have. The record is 8 from Newcastle, they usually gift chances”"

Last summer they both came in my local. I was sitting at the bar when they both came in. I clocked them and did a bit of a double take. You could see Wilder thinking here we go someone is going to ask for a selfie. I said “you’re Peter Smith” and started blowing a bit of smoke up his arse telling him he was one of the few good reasons for watching the Albion back when he played. We chatted for a couple of minutes until Wilder got the hump and said “c’mon Smithy, you are going to be dining out for weeks that someone has recognised you” he picked up their drinks and stormed off.So I reckon he might be a bit of a self obsessed tosspot.”“If you could compare every Premier League club to a sandwich what would it be?Arsenal – Half a coronation chicken sandwich, nice ingredients, used to be a hit a few years back. Doesn’t quite finish the jobAston Villa – Egg mayo, people say it’s great but I can’t warm to itBrentford – Cheese and piccalilli – Tries to be like Brighton, but isn’t quite as goodBournemouth – Prawn mayo – Deceptively expensive, ingredients make you ill if poorly storedBrighton – Cheese and Pickle – Simple ingredients, perfect sandwichBurnley – A drawing of a sandwich. It’s like a sandwich, but much, much bleaker the closer you getChelsea – Deep fried philly cheesesteak. Expensive sandwich with big name ingredients. Makes you sickCrystal Palace – I can’t improve on @Titanic – Amazing workEverton – Plain ham sandwich – Been around for ages, doesn’t really add muchFulham – Chicken salad sandwich – Bland and inoffensiveLiverpool – Chip butty, no ketchup. Close to being great, but something just isn’t quite rightLuton – Tuna and sweetcorn sandwich – Punches well above it’s weight.Man City – Gilded steak and horseradish. Wins multiple awards but nobody quite knows who paid for the ingredientsMan Utd – Banana sandwich – Grew up thinking it was a really good sandwich. Can’t stand it nowNewcastle – Marmite sandwich – In principle, good, but divides opinion and can leave a nasty taste in the mouthN. Forest – Cheese, Jam, Mustard, Salt, Sweetener, Apple slices, butter and egg sandwich – Too many ingredients to really work coherentlySheffield Utd – Gravy sandwich – Inedible, only a small group of people care it exists. Isn’t liked down southTottenham – Expensive white bread, no filling in a very pricy packet – Costs a lot to buy, but has no substance where in mattersWest Ham – Plain cheese sandwich – Route one, straight down the middleWolves – Salad sandwich. Solid, but unfulfilling and a little dull”“Surely Sheffield United  would have to have some Hendo’s in it?”“Sheffield Utd in the late 70.s police escort to/from the station, still attacked by hooligan northerners was the most scared I have ever been a football match”"

Then the following season we lost 2-0 at Bramall Lane and then the infamous 0-0 and ghost goal.They were terrible in 20/21 but still beat us 1-0 when we were flying.Overall Wilder has just one loss in 7 games v us and we’re trying to avoid losing at Bramall Lane on a fourth consecutive occasion. “

(They are my dads team therefore my second team so have watched them a lot).They are as hardworking as anyone but Ramsdale is not a patch on Henderson and O’Connell was their best defender last season. Those are big misses for a side like them, as is the fact McBurnie and Brewster are big money signings and their attack has been poor most of the season baring odd spurts from Sharp and McGoldrick.If we do as we have been doing and match their work ethic we win, and can afford to make some changes and still do that.

It just seems to be a well run and well coached club and a place I could see lads like Laird or Mejbri thriving in their development.Unfortunately for us, I think they have probably outgrown that now and will be looking to entice their own prospects and stars, rather than develop them for clubs they’ll rightly be targeting as rivals.Also, I’d love to see Wilder get a shot at the Ireland job in the future.

Berge has been really good in games I have seen.

We haven’t look rattled at all, with the mind games & sideswipes from Wilder and the rest of their brigade. This is the reason I think we will win, our players have to much class, quality & experience, and know the end goal.  Wilder IMO will be riling up there players all week, as a do or die sort of game, to the point were I think they will lose focus, discipline and overall the game as they won’t be able to compete with quality.  Lets not forget CC has managed in some big derbies before like Besitkas, Sporting.

They’ll be very composed and any fouls will come around the centre circle and thgem stifling the quick kick. The score will dictate how the second half starts. If it’s 0-0 or they’re winning then there’ll be no change. Most of the scum will take a draw at ours as it keeps them above us and Wilder will be the same.If we’re in front then we’ll see a different United.

This is how we should approach our away games as we’re not going to play teams off the park away from home. they’ll have a lot of possession but we need to make sure that when we get it, we are effective with it.Sheffield United had a really poor start and I kind of wish we’d have had this game in the early part of the season as they seem to have picked up some momentum having won 5 out of their last 7 and not lost since August.

Then we gallopped into a 3-1 lead thanks to a pair of Gary Ford crackers.Then meltdown.And in the final minute poor Kevin Finney played a lovely through ball through to Brian Deane… Sad to think when you say Kevin Finney they think of that pass more than the Macclesfield goal the year before which started off the “Golden Years.” “

I watch the full game live and totally different to the highlight on match of the day. Gave a good account of themselves could control the ball under pressure, more passing plays were evident, played high up the pitch and like true Sheff Utd teams were very full bully boy mode.So based on the first game only they look more prepared and ready for this. “"

Plenty of hard work and commitment and maybe we can do something against them? We’ve beaten some good sides this year and come close in a couple of others.

Even at their place, if they are three goals down their confidence will be erroded. Two goals down and we’d only need a goal more I think, but we might struggle if we conceeded first. Although they have beaten a number of prem teams, they have been struggling teams who have gone on to get relegated, and finished mid table or below. There is a big difference in class between such teams and a top six or seven side. There is no doubt that we will prove a much sterner test than what they have faced previously. Kane recently destroyed one of the best defences in the country pretty much on his own, Eriksen is different class, as is Lloris. We should win this comfortably, but it is all important to make the most of the advantage of being at home, not underestimate them, but to begin with the right attitude and get a decent result.

But, we are a bigger club than Wet Spam and Southampton. This is over two legs. I just don’t see us losing, and there is nothing wrong with that. You can still respect a club while acknowledging the gap in quality. Why should we think a team two leagues below us has any chance over two legs? We have a lot more quality than they do. Would any of their squad make it into ours? Even on the bench? The two legs protects against freak results. I think over two legs we’ll win by 3 or 4 goals.

They turned us over in the cup and they sit 15 points above us and 7 points clear of the third placed team in the Championship. Barring a major disaster they look a good bet for automatic promotion. They did have a blip midweek with a loss against Boro and their manager was sent to the stands for complaining about their third goal. Regardless they are a tough nut to crack and this will be a real test for us to see whether we have got what it takes.”

Will be a very good test for us and whilst a win would be most welcome a loss not the end of the world in this highly competitive and crazy league.There fans seem to think that the season is catching up with them and taking it’s toll. Tired and leggy is the consensus. We’ve had a days rest compared to them, their manager banned from the touchline and without a win on the road since December.They needed an injury time goal to nick a point at Qpr and got shut out at Rotherham for a point.

But it wont be the end of the world – we are more than capable of catching them.They appear to have a shouty-arrogance, but that could well be their downfall. They`ve compared what they did to us last season – but that was a different team, with a different mentality, physicality, tactics and fitness. Wilders team of twelve months ago bears no comparison whatsoever. Our Management Team and the capabilities of our team an depth of squad, is far superior to last years.They may have convinced themselves they have the upper hand, but they are fooling themselves. It appears they are really worried.Some of their aging players may not have the stamina to sustain 90 minutes and, although they have the odd gem in their side, their physicality highlights their lack of technical ability and skill.

I get that we can’t compete with the Premier League money, but it’s worth remembering that Sheffield United finished 11th in League One in 2015-16, our first year back in the Championship. Since then, they’ve been promoted twice (three times surely this year) and spent a couple of seasons in the Premier League. Similarly, Luton finished 11th in League Two that season, having only recently been promoted back from the Conference.

Obviously the Prem parachute money is a big play and they need to go up soon, but have not so far as I can see done a Notts Forest who are blowing it big time with a massive set of liabilities a bit like us but we were on a slightly smaller scale.”"

Finally we also have a small cluster of players who are simply not good enough at this level but are seeing gametime due to injuries (Vaughan, Connolly etc).

My only criticism is that I know how good we can be and I would like to see us play to what I perceive as our strengths. I also have nasty memories of what a defensive approach can lead to in this league and defeats can stack up very quickly.”"

The issue is we aren’t applying ourselves properly away from home. If we wouldn’t have been so negative away from home and maybe had a touch more luck with dodgy refs we could easily have another 5 or 6 points that would have us floating around the automatic places. If anything I’d say we’ve not got as many points as we probably should have.”

If we had carried on being positive and claimed 3 points confidence and mood would have changed as it is any side who have a go at us are likely to prosper.”

Hopefully we just sit on the nil-nil from the off, play plenty sideways and backwards passes and the big boot to no bugger up top. No doubt that would be the right way to play rather than just go at them from the off.”"
Pre-Match View From Wigan,https://roysviewfrom.com/2018/12/31/pre-match-view-from-wigan-4/,2018-12-31,“From what I’ve seen Sheffield play variation of a 3-4-3 with the wing backs attacking like wingers and the left and right centre half acting like full backs. They play a system bit like what we did in that 4 month epic spell under Roberto when we went from garbage to world beaters almost over night but instead of having the left and right of the front wide they play more of a triangle with a main pairing and one behind. So i think the 4-1-4-1 we used in the first half against Swansea would be a sensible way to go as they are very fluid in their shape so we will need to control the midfield if we want to have any hope of getting a result.”

Sheff U will definitely be better on and off the ball and I think they’ll press us hard and high – so it we’ll have to work a lot harder to find the time and space Millwall afforded us. Our dfenders being caught in posession is probably a bigger threat with Sheff U’s approach, so we need to pick our moments of when to play out and when to clear our lines.It’ll be interesting to see how much progress Toure will have made after having over another week with them. So really difficult to know what to expect from us – which hopefully will work in our favour and catch Sheff U by suprise.”"

This could work either way and we could catch them cold or alternatively as KDZ says their high press game could cause us problems as we struggle to get to grips with a passing game.For me it could be 1-0 to us if we do catch them out or 3-0 to them if we try and fail to beat their press whilst trying to make the changes. “

Dawson and Bishop in midfield kind of hold their position and it’s almost as if Alexander has instructed the front four to do their thing and them two stay put. The problem is, when the front four are misfiring and we need a spark from one of the two central midfielders to kick start them, the problems start arising. I like Bishop don’t get me wrong,but,as soon as Mantom get’s fitter, i’d stick him in, or else what happened against the Shrews and Charlton will happen way more often.”"

We are not going to thump every team that visit Glanford Park although I’m convinced Southend and Gillingham will not be the last.When we are not quite on our game, results like last night can obviously seem a little disappointing but you have to step back and look at the bigger picture. We have picked up four points from the last two and go into a derby two points clear at the top towards the end of September . I’m sure we’d have all been delighted with if we’d have been offered that before we started, but we also have to be careful and ensure that we do not fall back into the way of playing under Robins etc. That said I don’t think Alexander will tolerate it and hopefully a win on Saturday will put a smile back on everyones faces.”"

It may be the rotation which players see as a blame culture. The changes made last night seemed to punish players for the previous games performance which seems to do nothing but reduce the effectiveness of the team as a whole. Us fans also have too many permutations to choose from when we do our team selection. Some of us extol the virtues of youth but berate when their experience lets us down. We has simply lost that cutting edge and in my eyes adding two strikers to the squad last month didn’t help as the ones we had before did perfectly well but our main contributor to the goal tally seems to be now ineffective from open play as he is marked out of the game. The inability to compensate for that is down to the manager whose honeymoon period has him checking out of his room to go home. We will have yet another line-up at Sheffield. Tinkering again. Ranieri was the tinkerman but he had the most settle squad in the Prem last season and look what that achieved. Then you look at what it achieved this season when they lose a key midfielder.”

Watching it go to a defender and the defender proceeding to hoof it up field.No thought process is there, it is just hit and hope and it is not effective one bit other than for the opposition who once again can regain possession. It is easy to blame the two strikers but when no actual service is given then it isn’t going to work.Players need to start focusing and making better decisions on and off the ball.

It is also the game which set our current highest attendance at NYS. Due to segregation it will probably remain the highest for, well, forever. Unless we ever expand the stadium.It was part of the ‘deedar double’ that season, after we beat Wednesday in the league cup earlier in the season.Anyway, they came here, spent most of the first half passing the ball around in their own 18 yard box to show us how superior they were. At some point they went forward and scored a goal. Clumsy Claude Davis was also very lucky not to have conceded at least one penalty.We went in at half time a goal down having barely had a touch of the ball.Legend has it that manager Steve Evans actually apologised to his players for getting his tactics all wrong, and sent them back out with some fire in their bellies and sure enough we were a different team in the second half, putting in a proper Rotherham United display of gritty determination coupled with a touch of class here and there. Kieren Agard, almost anonymous up to this point, smashed in an equaliser from somewhere up on Sheffield Road. Clumsy Claude almost gave away a stonewaller (again) at the other end, before we were awarded what I remember being a really soft penalty, one even I wouldn’t have given us, which was converted by Daniel Nardiello. Recent world cup hero Harry Maguire was in the Blades lineup that day too.We didn’t know it at the time but we’d go on to win promotion that season at the first attempt while it would take Sheffield United, perennial promotion favourites and already with three seasons behind them at that level, another three years to get out of that league.”"

What an awful day that was. Lost the rugby World Cup in the morning, p1ssed it down all day and 3-0 down by half time. The only thing that got us through the first half was the thought of a pie and ale at half time. Neither alcohol or hot food was available. We settled for a bovril and wished we hadn’t made the trip.Aside from that, Sheffield is a great city with plenty of good boozers. Despite lacking in qualifications I used to cook all the hot food for the concourses at Bramall Lane – the kitchen was in the tier above the away end so you can imagine my surprise when there was no hot food at half time. My advice is eat before you get there or grab a pie pre-match. And if they still have the same set up, avoid the burgers!”"

A repeat of the 1-0 win we achieved against the Blades in the 2009 Play Off Final would suit for a variety of reasons. Not least of which is Nick Pope’s pursuit of the Golden Glove where he holds a narrow lead over Alisson of Liverpool, Ederson of Manchester City and of course Dean Henderson. Burnley are in great form having picked up 21 points in their last 10 League games. Sheffield United suffered two successive 3-0 defeats against Newcastle and Manchester United on the resumption before returning to winning ways with a 3-1 win over Spurs last time out. The Blades will probably stick to their tried and trusted system of three centre halves combined with overlapping fullbacks. For Burnley Jay Rod, Chris Wood, JBG and Robbie Brady have all returned to training. Of these I expect Rodriguez (if declared fit) to start up front with Vydra. The fixture may come a little too soon for the other 3 to feature. Jack Cork went off injured at Selhurst Park so Pieters may be asked to continue in the left of midfield berth.”"

Pre-Match View From Norwich,https://roysviewfrom.com/2018/01/19/pre-match-view-norwich/,2018-01-19,"“Hopefully the Chelsea game actually boosts morale etc. somewhat and we can take it to an out of sorts Sheff Utd.I just wonder what the teams going to be. Pinto looked out on his ** at the end of that and no doubt a few others were as well like Oliveira who has needed a rest for a while now.We have a pretty well rested Tettey at least and the likes of Reed and Vrancic haven’t played too much recently. I do just worry we’ll be short going forward.It might be 5 at the back (Stiepermann could come in at right back?) and then Murphy through the middle up top with the 4 man midfield (Tettey, Reed, Vrancic, Maddison) sitting narrow behind him at this rate.”"
Pre-Match View From Norwich,https://roysviewfrom.com/2018/01/19/pre-match-view-norwich/,2018-01-19,"“I hope the recovery rate and their general conditioning allows enough time for those knackered at the end of the game to be ready for Saturday.Pinto had cramp which shouldn’t preclude him from playing the next game.Didn’t seem as though anyone picked up any knocks, so it’s then just a matter of overcoming the fatigue.I hope Farke can get them buzzing to be back out playing with the same intensity and application”"
Pre-Match View From Norwich,https://roysviewfrom.com/2018/01/19/pre-match-view-norwich/,2018-01-19,"“Think many felt that Norwich would take a confidence boost after the Arsenal game and carry it into the league – which really didn’t happen.Fatigue is about the mind as well as the body – they should all be able to play 90 mins again three days after the Chelsea game, but fatigue often results in poor decision making and lack of concentration. Luckily unlike after the Arsenal game, Norwich will have a week between Sheff U and Brentford – hopefully this will allow them time to recuperate.While it didn’t look like injuries happened in the game, although Reed did come off with a knock, fatigue injuries are most likely to occur a day or two after the game. So they may find some players have issues today or tomorrow.Guessing Stiepermann, Edwards and Watkins will get some minutes on Saturday. But ultimately don’t think the result is hugely important as chances of getting into the play-offs are incredibly slim.”"

Should we win another club that is reeled in and dependant on other results we could be within touching distance of the top 6.Should we lose the gap against so many clubs gets nearer 9 points and winning 3 games more than so many clubs is unlikely.”

Sure they play a high intensity game like us and Leeds, but apart from the nous of Sharp that comes with age (a la Grant Holt in his prime, lots of nudges and elbows etc.) and the occasional late tackle from Robert Fleck’s nephew John (its in the genes) the rest of the team focus on playing the ball forward, on the ground, as quickly as possible.  If we go out and expect them to clog, that would be a big mistake.  We should focus on playing our own game and we will beat them.  Try anything different and lose our focus and we will lose.”"

Sheffield United losing last week though has taken the pressure off us a bit, in the sense that as we’re above them this is a must-not-lose game, rather than a must-win which it probably would’ve been had we gone into this game below them. It would be fantastic though if we won, not only would we go 6 points clear but it would send Wilder and all their moron fans into a crying frenzy just like it did when we beat them at Brammal Lane last season.Same team as Birmingham if everyone is fit.

He’s passionate, managing the team he supports, and does things he thinks are right irrespective of who he annoys. He may have gone a bit crazy over our win there last year, but most of what he said was correct – we were pretty obnoxious that day. Equally, he recognises that we are a threat and that his bunch will need to find a way to win. Sheff Utd are a proper football team – physical, but not much whingeing or diving and rolling around.

They have the second leanest defence so far, but again from what i remember they have a tendency to dick about in their own half, susceptible to the press.

We got the ball forward as quickly as possible and whoever had the ball seemed to have runners giving them options, or creating space for others. It seemed a really positive display. We are certainly going to need to keep that going, and even up the level a bit, as we face tougher opposition on Tuesday night.Just a final observation. Surely it must go against us that we have travelled to Bristol and back on Saturday, and then head to Sheffield on Tuesday night, whilst they have two home games in a row. I know these things level out over the course of a whole season, but it must cause extra fatigue for our squad.”"

Quite a cool nickname that dates back to historical times when we used to make things in this country, less relevant now but a nice nod to the past.  Can’t profess to have seen much of them but from what I can gather they have played some quite decent football whilst being solid and organised defensively when needed. They have also scored in each of their away games so far (alarm bells ring).On the unofficial scale of must win games this is right up near the top for us, only games where you will actually be relegated there and then would be above this. If we are to survive this season it is games like this that we simply must win, I mean no offence to Sheffield United (I did that earlier) but we are now at the point where home games against non top 6, and especially newly promoted, sides need to be won, especially with Spurs away to follow.”"

Only a crazy mess up by their keeper denied at least a point.There’s no way Watford would have stood up to Liverpool like United did.

We have more individual quality but Sheffield United have players that know their responsibilities and have a compact and solid 5-3-2 which Liverpool struggled to break down at the weekend. They are narrow and have 2 holding midfielders which makes it hard to play between the lines so I think we would be best off attacking them down the wings, therefore I would like to see us play Sarr on the right and Deulofeu on the left.”"

We are sadly languishing at the bottom, 6 points from safety.Sheffield Utd will certainly be looking for the win, but should be wary after our last two games., During pre-season Chris Wilder actually infused all of his players with the finest Sheffield Steel. Think Wolverine but a bit more steely.This has largely been attributed as the cause of their rise up the table.Interestingly some players have also taken on other abilities similar to Wolverine. Most famously Billy Sharp can sprout Sheffield Steel butter knives out of his hands. It is for this reason he is called Butterine. This means he isn’t as dangerous as Wolverine, but is much more yourself at breakfast time to get the squads toast buttered quickly, freeing up more time for training.”"

It will be tense. It will be tough. Bramall Lane will be noisy. I still carry those scars from the last ill fated playoff visit there but that was then and this is now. Now is not the time to embrace our inner Hughton and look for every reason NOT to believe. To convince ourselves that we’ll do “a Forest” because we had a tough 45 mins at Bournemouth and let in an injury time fluke at Hull. Now is the time to embrace everything our fantastic manager has installed in our club. To believe. To be positive. To all give absolutely everything for these final three (it will be three) games. To make it happen.Even if we are slightly behind after the first leg I’d still be confident we could turn it around at home. If you thought the noise level against Liverpool were something… “"

One is that you just have one of those games where everything, from lousy refereeing decisions to the run of the ball, goes against you. The other is that you yourself play badly.Both of those have happened in away games in recent weeks — against Luton and then in the second half against Bournemouth.And in both of those games, we still only conceded one goal.So it’s not unreasonable to think that even if we had a bad day on Saturday, we take a 1-0 deficit to the City Ground.

We could learn an awful lot from it.We are not interested in their style of football even though they have stayed true to it and it has served them well. However route 1 aerial tennis with a football and taekwondo without it is not what Coventry fans are used to seeing even in our darkest of days. We are particularly interested in their specialist module entitled how to get results when outclassed. Following our that will teach them sequence of results against Preston, Swansea and Luton, teams we owed a good old fashioned hammering we should also register on Sheffield Utd’s payback course featuring their demolition of former boss Chis Wilder’s high flying Middlesbrough team.Sheffield Utd in my opinion are masters of playing referees. They seem to have this aura whereby their clogging is regarded as hard man football and part of the game by referees and when the opposition try to match fire with fire it is foul play and they suffer a sending off or a penalty. There was a time when B Sharp ( pen) on the score sheet against us on our annual visits to Bramall Lane was as traditional as Halloween.If you combined their footballing know how and ability to get results; they are as tenacious and resilient as hell, with our invention and style of football you would have a wonderful combination destined for the Premier League and staying there without the need to worry about the play offs.Irrespective of our predicament we raise our game against Sheffield Utd.

Pre-Match View From Blackburn,https://roysviewfrom.com/2022/02/22/pre-match-view-from-blackburn-5/,2022-02-22,"“Legend has it that the Blades tend to attract the working-class Sheffielder, whilst the Owls are viewed as the more aspirational, middle-class club. Whichever opponent, Rovers have suffered some heartbreak in the Steel City over the years; the most memorable recent victories tending to come at Hillsborough rather than Bramall Lane.The (if you believe it) working-class Blades have traditionally proved to be obdurate opponents and similar can be expected this February. The victory at Ewood earlier this season afterthatFulham game, proved to be a catalyst for a sustained run of positive results which catapulted Rovers into automatic promotion contention. The New Year however, has served only to pour cold water on those heady dreams. Poor recent form means that Rovers really need to secure a decent Bramall Lane result this time, else the great work of November and December will turn us into footballing Bullseye contestants… “Look at what youcouldhave won…”The form table after the draw at The Hawthorns certainly calls out the size of the task ahead for Rovers. A re-energised and re-invigorated United are seemingly starting the sort of late season surge that can easily propel a team to the play-offs. We all know the challenges that Rovers currently face in the goal scoring department and given the Blades’ defensive record, this match in the Steel City requires Rovers to be on their mettle.”"

Look at what Lobsterman Carlos Carvalhal is doing up at Swansea? A fantastic job, and it proves that there are a few tactical managers back in the championships that could do a better job than your Sam Alyerdice’s. Slavisa is used to working on small budgets, and that gives him a great advantage over those big spenders who get duff information on overrated players. It only takes 1 or 2 flop players to put managers in the sack race. Remember Chris Houton back up at Norwich in the prem a few years back? 1 Van Winkle who was overrated, and Chris had the chance to get Wilfred Bony, and he chose Winkle, who got him the sack. At any level, you have to make good calls and good decisions. Slavisa made a good call when he got Mitro on board. I have no doubt tht this Fulham squad could make mid table comfortably back in the prem. Slavisa, i am confident would be better than Koeman and that other Dutch guy who got sacked.

Plus S U I would think will be more nervous than Fulham.If by any chance we do not happen to win on Saturday, it will not be the end of the world, it may feel like it but it most certainly will not be over. It may be more difficult but there are still enough matches left to catch another club.Of course SU will not roll over and let us tickle their tummy, but nobody does in this Division when they play us. Because we took 4 points from what we’re potentially difficult matches, the players will be confident and raring to go, and if things do not go according to plan, they will move on to the next match and try and win that one.”"

I doubt it.WE can do this, but even if we don’t win, i will still believe we can stay up, until it’s mathematically impossible.I think we will get points in unexpected places.These types of team like Burnley and Sheff U , are maybe more difficult for us to play against than the so called better quality teams. Not just their style, but they are fighters who always give their all, often with a lot of ‘gamesmanship’ integral to their tactics and style, with managers who demand these things, and it is what enables them to be in the Prem.A potentially very tough game, and banana skin with the expectations, as said, but I hope we can do it, if not we move onto the next game.”"

We have lacked punch in the box and it is difficult to see where goals are coming from.The manager is selecting our best players, we have not had big injury problems but it seems that our tactics have been well observed and managers are able to set up their teams to counter our attacks.Changes are needed, we are simply hitting our heads against brick walls.”"

Sheffield United are knocking on the door of the playoffs, as they lie in 8th, just four points adrift of 6th place. It has been an impressive season for last years League one winners, helped by Billy Sharpe, who a few weeks ago became one of the only three players to score 200 goals in the English league this century.We should hopefully have Smyth available again from the start, and it is encouraging the Luongo made it through Saturday without any problems which is encouraging. I fear it’ll be tough on Tuesday night as we enter that part of the season where some teams have a lot to play for, and others (like ourselves I am pleased to say) are destined for mid table, and can’t really do much to change that.

Last season everyone was so gob smacked about what went on and felt really put out. But for a club our size, 17th is about right.

In all, a back 3 you’d be more than happy with, but like a lot of Champ central defenders, can be exposed down the sides.

Will keep the ball moving…so we mustn’t give him time to bypass our press.  John Fleck – red carded at their place last season.  Tenacious midfielder with moments of quality.  Need to commit him on the stretch, as he can’t resist a tackle. Mark Duffy is the dangerman – bit of a journeyman, but found his identity at SU, and a real threat.  Will cheat in midfield, and if you think where Weimann was picking up the ball in 20 yards of space v BR, that’s where Duffy will want to receive the ball, but instead of Weimann having one forward colleague, Duffy will have two, and their launching of breakaways is very impressive.

After nothing in the first week, there was the long trek to Leeds and now this long ******* of a trek to Sheffield. Now you’d think league would set it so that clubs would not get this sort of idiot fixture organisation that leaves such long gaps between home games and a chance to see your heroes being embarrassing at home again.Sheffield United are the surprise package so far and this is definitely going to be the hardest game Reading have had so far as the Blades are actually fairly useful and well capable of beating anyone in this division by the look of things so a Reading team that can be very erratic at times is not going to phase them in the slightest.So one wonders whether this game will see the usual misfiring Reading turn up or the one that did rather well for themselves at Leeds last week to show exactly what they can do when they put their minds to it. If the latter then just perhaps Reading’s season has just kicked off. If the former then it’s going to be a very long season.Sheffield will have bright prospect (chased by Liverpool, Arsenal and Newcastle apparently) David Brooks fit and ready to continue his, so far, stunning form but defender Kieron Freeman is likely to be missing after suffering a suspected dislocated knee last week.

However Reading’s overall form in play is very slowly on the turn into something better so if Reading get it right and Sheffield don’t there could be happy outcome for the beleaguered followers of the hoops. Sheffield United had a good start but, fortunately, it would appear that now is the best time of the season so far to play them as they have only recorded 2 wins from their last 8 games. However both of those wins were against currently struggling sides (Wigan and Brentford) while the 3 defeats they’ve suffered in the same run have all been against promotion contenders (Forest, Derby and Leeds). As ever Reading’s opponents are injury free while Reading’s injury list is still as bad as ever. So another hard game awaits then.

Billy Sharp continues to defy all logic and actually be decent, and their keeper is a coin-throwing nob.I’d say United are a good bet for the play-offs, and fair dos to them – at least they aren’t bloody Wednesday.They have the  oldest professional football stadium in the world and it has the concourses to prove it.Bramall Lane was converted from an international cricket ground in the late 19th century but only got a proper fourth side during the 1970s. Centrally located in the city, the stadium is deceptively impressive and quite grand once you get inside, although surprisingly only holds 1300 more than Ewood Park.

I think Mowbray said post match that Downing will have the night off, and that Brereton and Adarabioyo are unlikely to be fit. For me, Chapman, Armstrong and Rothwell all have to start, theres no point giving the former 20 minutes at the end, let him start a game. The 4th place in the attacking positions I would give to Gallagher, to try and get him a goal. Dack obviously did get one in the cup, and theres an argument to get him firing but I would have him on the bench.”"

They’ve managed to lurch from one disaster to another ever since relegation a few years ago.Indeed, new manager Chris Wilder has come out with a similar attack on his players as Neil Harris did after our humiliating 5-1 reverse at Peterborough, for their more modest 3-0 defeat at home to Southend United.However, you get the sense that Harris is calling out one or two individuals & looking at either forcing them into to his team ethic or see them depart – whereas Wilder has admitted that many of the players he inherited are not made of the right stuff for a club the size of Sheffield United, who are having to cope with being the big scalp for the likes of Southend United in this division, and nor does it seem that his new recruits are quite prepared for that challenge either.It seems therefore that Saturday will be a battle between two sets of players completely under the microscope of both managers and fans. As a side note – feel far more sympathy for Sheffield United than those cry-babies Charlton. I lived up there and they are a decent, passionate bunch and have been totally sold short by their board. They’ve sold and sold good players and replaced them with crap. Their dynamic with Wednesday also reminded me of ours with Palace.

In 1978, the United manager Harry Haslam watched the 17-year-old Maradona in action on a scouting trip to Argentina and was so impressed he immediately arranged a £200,000 deal. But the transfer fell through when the Second Division club failed to stump up extra cash on top of the fee. The biggest ‘the one that got away’ ever?"

It was because Wednesday stopped using the ground that the landlords at Bramall Lane decided to start Sheffield United. United fans respect and thank Wednesday for that all the time.
Pre-Match View From Millwall,https://roysviewfrom.com/2017/12/01/pre-match-view-from-millwall-5/,2017-12-01,"T is for Tevez. Carlos Tevez scored the goals that helped keep West Ham up at the expense of Sheffield United, even though it was proven that his contract didn’t meet FA rules.

Then comes the AOB conundrum, Harris again brings in Skalak to no real avail then we come to Morison, an avalanche of criticism that he had to be put out to grass and again Harris done it at QPR and the Bradshaw Gregory combination was a washout.Factor in the loss of Hutchinson, Saville and Jed Wallace’s, among others, mysterious loss of form and we are starting to look like a club in trouble. It’s hard to see where our next goal is coming from, let alone win.

Where’s the steel? The nastiness? And if Williams is off the boil with his passing, then we are effectively carrying a useless passenger most games – as he won’t go ‘Right, I’m having a mare, but I can roll my sleeves up and get stuck in at least’.We need to get back to have a whole team of tough characters with a bit of aggression (in that controlled modern sense); like when we had Craig, Dunne, Forde, Frampton, Harris, Alexander, Robinson, Abdou and Ward were all in and around the team.”"

Boro got out of their mini slump and beat Karankas toothless troops 2-0 thanks to goals from Daniel “CR7” Ayala and Downing. We keep our place in the play offs but Milwall are somehow keeping up the pressure. Our next game is already on tuesday night as we go to fellow play off contenders Sheffield United in the first of a number of “6 pointers”. United lost their last game 2-3 away at Barnsley despite leading 2-1 with 25 minutes to go. United are in bad shape at the moment and have only won 1 game in 7 which was at home againt the mighty Burton 5 games ago. They are trailing Boro by 4 points so the onus is on them to attack us. That might free up some space for Traore, Downing, Howson and Bamford on the break which is likely the tactics Pulis will employ.They seem a bit nervous about the game knowing that a loss or maybe even a draw could end their season. They know they are not in great form and their defence isn’t getting much praise. If the players are thinking along those lines too I predict a very tactical game and probably only one goal in it. We really need to get at them and not let their confidence grow. They are in a bad shape and we need to rattle them from kick off.”"

Pre-Match View From Southampton,https://roysviewfrom.com/2020/12/11/pre-match-view-from-southampton-3/,2020-12-11,"“Sheffield United come across as a plucky team fighting against the odds. Which is somewhat true. But it has gone a bit under the radar that they have spent a reasonably amount of money since coming up. They spent 64m last season, and 56m according to Transfermarkt. That’s with very little recouped in sold players. In the same period we have bought 52m and 35.2m respectively, and received 24.5m and 23.6m. Of course, we have built up a more developed squad over a number of seasons, and that the money that they have spent is still little compared to most other sides. But I think it would surprise people how much they have spent and a 1 point return is pretty dreadful for that outlay. I think we will win this one. We have scored in all EPL games this season except the opening game and have scored 2 goals in a match 8 times. Ings back, Che looks the business, JWP freekick threat, and even Vestegaard threat off set pieces and I think we should be okay scoring a couple. I look at Sheffield United’s attack and think, will they score 1, let alone 2 against us? Probably not in all honesty unless the defense does something dumb (Bednarek I’m looking at one of your little air swings). Especially if Vestegaard plays like how he did Monday night. It’ll be tough, they will fight and scrap. But ultimately we will win.”"

Let’s be honest, football viewing nowadays is for foreigners and second gen migrants who do the weird screeches, spakky hand signals, pidgin Ingrish innit and exaggerate that a tackle by Bellerin was ‘savage’ on fan TV programmes.Best to cut the whole farce loose, leave it to the shit munchers and focus on something else.”"

Coutts for example, they were shitting themselves when they thought he was out for the Wendies game. He’s been poor other clubs, but Wilder has set the side up Davies-esq to hide player weaknesses, and bring out their strengths.Wilder has done an incredible job there. He knew the club well before he arrived, knew exactly what was needed in terms of players & ethos, and coz he’s a blade they all thrive on him so bare with rough patches.

Even at 10 men we had moments (the penalty for example). All in all it wasn’t our day, but they were just organised. They’ve lost a lot of momentum over the last 2 months.”"
Pre-Match View From Wolves,https://roysviewfrom.com/2018/02/02/pre-match-view-wolves/,2018-02-02,"“Have a few blade friends who were giving it large earlier in the season but have spent the last few months in a massive retreat. As a result, I have a unique insight into the psyche of the average blade and so here’s their standard excuses for when they get beat:1. They would have beaten us if they’d had their first choice midfield available. Whenever they lose it’s always down to them being one or more short in midfield. Admittedly, this argument is going to be more difficult to pull-off now they’ve signed a few. Their first choice midfield are: coutts, some bloke who isn’t coutts, another bloke who isn’t coutts, and another bloke who I’ve never heard of but definitely isn’t as good as coutts. By the way coutts is the best player in the championship and is highly rated by all SU fans. P.S. Coutts suffered a broken leg in a match against Burton literally ages ago but this doesn’t stop SU fans constantly harping on about him. As an update, SU fans are currently petitioning the EFL to get Burton’s villain of the piece banned for life despite the fact that said villain merely attempted to block coutts’ shot and the referee didn’t see the challenge as a foul never mind a booking.2. Their entire squad, training ground, & stadium, cost less than Neves. They’re very fond of proclaiming that they have the smallest budget in the championship (except they don’t) and will be quick to point this out when they get stuffed. There’s nothing at all ironic in this position despite the fact that they bought promotion from league 1 with the largest budget of all competing clubs and posted a thumping £6 million loss last year. As an aside, Neves isn’t fit to lace Coutts’ boots.3. Undoubtedly our win will be down to us scoring a worldy. Whenever SU lose it’s because the opposition either: a) score a worldy; b) played out of their skins, e.g. Fulham; c) got lucky, as in, Fulham scored 5 lucky goals.4. SU got a player undeservedly sent off. As in, since when did a two footed studs up leg breaking lunge 1ft off the ground warrant a red card??? Flecks’ perfectly legitimate well timed tackle was deemed worthy of a red by the overly officious referee of their encounter with Bristol City. Korey Smith, the villain of the piece for successfully influencing the referee due to his theatrics, stupidly took things way too far by actually going off injured. Yes, he went off injured and the knuckle draggers still say he was a play acting wimp. Football is now played by pansies. BC went on to beat SU but only because Fleck was undeservedly sent off and BC got extremely lucky. BC definitely didn’t deserve to win and Wilder definitely didn’t **** things up with his tactics and substitutions. P.S. Wilder is God since achieving promotion from league 1 despite his hands being tied and forced to work miracles with the largest budget in the division.5. We were nothing special and they battered us at their place. They won’t mention us being a man down for 80 minutes.Don’t forget: you heard them here first. “"

I know that there have been greater matches I have attended – at Wembley and Cardiff 🙂BUT that was a fantastic night. We needed a draw to be champions and Blades needed to draw to be promoted. It was all a cut and thrust honest battle and 2-2 with about 10 minutes to go. Blades then got a free kick in a dangerous position about 20 yards outside Wolves penalty area – and the Blades player then picked the ball up and moved the ball back 10 yards!! It was clear to everyone that this was the signal to both sides not to ‘spoil the evening’ (or words to that effect! 😉 There was energy and fight for the last 10 minutes but somehow the ball ended out of play quite a lot with shots high into the terraces!! The funniest thing was right at the end the referee blew his whistle and the two Blades defenders thought the game was over – they ran over to their fans in the South Bank and climbed the fence – one was taking off his boots and one his shirt to throw them into the fans!! But the ref had only blown for offside or a foul!! Pandemonium!! They panicked and rushed back on to the pitch desperately putting back on what they had half taken off! :p 30 seconds later it was all over and they were able to go back and celebrate with their fans!It was great to be at a match where ALL the fans were celebrating afterwards – Blades and Wolves fans were best mates 🙂 (A bit like Wolves and Blackburn fans at the end of 2010/11 when we both narrowly escaped relegation)So I guess I have a bit of a soft spot for the Blades….”

We have played them twice since that 3-0 win in 2007 (prior to which, we had greeted our returning European Cup winners 25 years after they were crowned Champions of Europe). We lost 1-2 in a 2014 FA Cup tie and then drew 2-2 last season having been 2-0 up within the first 10 minutes. Overall we have won 59 and drawn 30 of the 125 league games between the two clubs. The Blades are founder members of the Football League and have been champions once in 1897-98. They have won the FA Cup 4 times in 1899, 1902, 1915 and in 1925. They have been outside of the top flight since 2007 and were in League One from 2011 until 2017. They are currently 11 points above us and a point nearer to the automatic promotion places (3) than we are to the play off spots (4). We really need to win this one, if only as pay back for the embarrassing 1-4 defeat we suffered at Bramall Lane 4 months ago. A win would see them on top of the league at the end of the game. A win for us would see us move within a point of sixth place.  Let’s make it a comfortable win and another clean sheet for us, so that we can begin the weekend in style and with a wide smile.”"

Both sides will look at it as a decent opportunity to get points.

They have enjoyed a season that has already exceeded their most ambitious expectations. However, they aren’t Manchester City and they aren’t Liverpool, and on our day, we can win this one! After all, we gave them a 3-goal start at Villa Park last season and still got a point. Their fans have been suffering from a bad case of over confidence”"

We were never as dismissing of the opposition like that when we were actually good and finishing in the top 6 regularly and we had much better players than they have who were being coveted by the top 4 teams. At the start of the season they would have just been happy to not finish 20th so it shows what success can do to clubs’ fans. Then again, most opposition fans don’t seem to like us – not sure why as we haven’t been much good for a long while now.”"

The break won’t change the organisation or the attitude, but it will have affected their confidence – when you’re on a roll and playing at an unexpectedly high level, a break of a few months can be very dangerous. I think they’ll be a little nervous and wondering if they’re still going to have the momentum that’s got them to where they are”"

No disrespect to them but they are a team that are greater than the sum of its parts. The danger for this kind of team is that it only takes 1 or 2 to not work as hard or as diligently as they did last season and the whole thing falls apart.

The composure can be attributed to lack of confidence, understandable given where they are in the table. This will not be an easy game for Villa, quite the opposite. I think in Sheffield United you have a team that know they’re realistically down, but with so much of the season left to play they are playing for dignity and actually playing quite freely, from what I watched. It’s just putting the ball in the net that’s problematic for them, and on any given day that might change.”"

No, from what I’ve seen is a team that have simply lacked that little bit of quality in front of goal, they are all still putting in a shift and don’t suffer lack of effort. Brewster has proven to be a completely ineffective signing for the Premier League, perhaps a naive signing when it’s clear to most observers that they needed more proven, experienced quality up front. Against Liverpool yesterday they could and should have scored at least a couple of goals. They didn’t and that’s their problem.

We are usually jinxed in these games but here’s hopingThis morning I was thinking as to why when we have top young strikers like Tovey and Winnall, and Smith on the bench , all established lads who have racked up many goals. Then how is it we see them struggling in our set up. Is it because our defence has to be propped up and this stops our supply to them, or is it our midfield who are letting both the defence and the strikers down. I think all the team tries hard and want to win, but there is something radically wrong somewhere. Do you think they are being bogged down with overkill on the coaching side. I think this is happening at the Blunts.”“I’m itching to back the Blunts big style to win this. But they haven’t won once in their last four games, and 6/4 looks too short. Equally, we look a bit too big to lay.We’ve no White (injured), Long (suspended) or Scowen (injured). So it’s Fred Karno’s circus at the back, and a lack of bite in midfield. If we’re lucky, we might get 20 minutes out of Williams, and mebbes Hammill will show something if he’s not too knackered from carrying this team. Our forwards don’t look as though they could score in a brothel.All in all, not a match I’m anticipating eagerly.

He said he hopes they stay down so they can have a crack at the JPT, or whatever it’ll be called, next season. They haven’t won at Wembley since the 1925 cup final. He’s in his 60s and wants to see them lift a trophy there while he’s still alive.”"

They do have vulnerabilities. Sounds like Cardiff absolutely bullied them. A quick goal for them and Bramall Lane will be buzzing. A quick goal for us and they’ll get very nervous.Be a good game hopefully, and a baramoter for both sides to see where we are against opposition we’re likely to be around come the end of the season.Ideally would have liked us to be more settled. Just hope young Williams is ok to go as he ran his proverbials off. He is critical if we play 5 in midfield.Big game for Moncur and Potts to show what they can do. Also Angus and Jackson need to show they are comfortable against Sharpe/Clarke/Evans.Be a good Derby game I reckon. They obviously have bigger Derby games but atmosphere should be decent.Hopefully Hecky has them prepped.

It will be a tough game for sure, but there confidence seems a little misplaced. They appear to be an entirely ordinary side, with very average players who come together to form a solid, effective, but ultimately rather steady team. I’m not overly concerned about their attack, I think Sharp/Evans/Clarke will be found out a little at this level. I reckon they’ll finish about 16-19th, decent enough but probably way below their fans expect. Score draw I reckon at the weekend, although if we were pleying them in a month or so, I’d be very confident of all three points.As an aside, I note there is no let up of the delusion and self appointed ‘massive clubitis’ amongst supporters of Championship teams. Forest fans seem aghast that they lost to us and now the Blades. Clearly 7 years of towing to beat the likes of Swindon and Gillingham has had little effect on expectation levels. The real big big clubs have yet to play us this season so that should be fun.”"

So do we owe them one?They have that Leon guy up front who’s having the season of his life, and seem to get results by playing a high tempo game with of course Billy Sharpe up front.  Paul Coutts got injured and he seems to have been missed. They’ve had a few dodgy results of late and have just lost at home to Bolton who have picked up a little recently. So, it’s a localish game for them, I assume they’ll sell out the allocation too.  So lots of dee dah’s around the train station pubs I guess? Plenty of them in the home fans only pub too no doubt, look out for flat caps and whippets, and cries of “how much?” We have a bit of a run going at home at the moment, but the games are coming thick and fast and maybe that could be a problem, but 5 changes at Ipswich and 3 points kind of makes you a bit more confident.

They’re a very good side with momentum from their promotion last season, a decent squad and arguably THE outstanding manager in the football league over the last couple of years in Wilder. The amount of points he has picked up with Northampton and the Blades is outstanding.However, we may be playing them at just the right time. We’re now on a decent run, they are winless in 4. Plus, their central midfield pairing of John Fleck (suspension) and Paul Coutts (broken leg) will both be unavailable and they have been an absolutely vital cog in their promotion back to this level and their success since.AN will have a few dilemmas after today. Horgan has made a big impact. Woods will be back available but a reshuffled backline have done well today. Johnson, who’s been class this season, must be an option as well. Harrop has been good in the last couple of sub appearances as well, and must now be pushing for a start ahead of Browne who, whilst working his socks off, doesn’t create or threaten enough from such an advanced midfield role.Could be a cracking game.”"

Keeping the wingbacks pegged back in a defensive role should be a top priority, which means pace on the wings, forcing Baldock and Stevens to keep tight to them and be hesitant to join the attack. Without them united have very little width from what I’ve seen of them, so Robinson and Barkhuizen on the wings is a must in my opinion, with Bodin either benched or played centrally.  O’Connell, Basham, and Stearman are all around 6’3″ so we’ll have no luck with the long balls forward we resort to at times, so keeping the ball on the ground is an absolute must as I doubt we’ll win many duels. Set pieces will pose a problem too, as we’ve been weak defending them recently and having tall centre halves and the likes of Leon Clarke and Clayton Donaldson attacking the ball will be very dangerous. ‘m expecting a few goals for both sides in this one.

Out the top 6 we have only lost to Middlebrough (twice) so far but with how football works that was always going to happen with it being Pulis. The issue we have had is consistency, as everyone keeps pointing out we probably do have the best squad in the league but football dont always work like that, if it did Man United wouldnt of been halfway down the premier league a few weeks ago with the players they have. If we play to our best and Sheffield United play to their best we will beat them comfortably same as we would every other team in the league as past results show.

Granted Wilder has done a very good job there but I think they’ve got found out a little bit now and since Coutts got injured they have won once in their last 8 league games. I fully expect them to finish around 8th/9th in the table. That said, I just can’t see how we go there and win with the amount of key players missing that we have. Our first choice keeper, first choice centre half, first choice right back, 3 first choice mid-fielders and our 3 first choice forwards. There isn’t a signal side in the division that could cope with that loss and had the pigs got a similar injury list, I’d fancy us to go there and beat them handsomely. My heart says we will go there and a few of the squad players will up their game hoping to make an impression on the new manager but I just think that some of them are very limited (Butterfield, Jones, Nuhiu, Joao, Palmer, Venancio) and the pigs with a settled side should come away with all 3 points.

They had a very good start to the season, there is no doubting that, but over the past couple of months, they have been found out. If you defend against them and don’t go all out attack, you can break them down and counter. Their whole game plan relies on breaking and attacking in numbers. Jos will know this and I’m confident he’ll come up with a game plan to shock them. Just like Bolton did. “"

Suddenly the roles are reversed, it’s no longer the rich aristocratic ball players against the feisty local boys made good.  It’s us who are up against it and I think that may suit us.

BUT… they are premier league standard and such we shouldn’t take too much notice of the ‘weak’ parts of their game. You would expect them to be a physical side that are well drilled and with the overlapping centre back tactics, not many managers would have come against that before, so we need to be aware and exploit space where ever we can. Tis will enjoy this one as he loves playing against sides where we his team are the underdogs. Imagine he can get us raring to go in this match.

When AFCB got relegated last July I was talking to some I sit with at Dean Court and told them not to worry, by the time we’re all back watching football, Bournemouth would be near the top of the Championship and Sheff U and Burnley would be staring relegation in the face. I was only half joking Sheff U are going down and Burnley are making a fight of it. Ramsdale is a good keeper but I doubt he’ll play. Having watched Mousset at AFCB before he went to Sheff U I can say he’s absolutely useless with no pace. (Perhaps that’s why he needs a Lamborghini which he obviously can’t drive either).I wonder how many of them played at the Mem when they drew here 0-0 in the season they went up? I would imagine it could be 2/3/4. Any statto know?I like Wilder, feet firmly on the ground, he’s no billy-big-b*but I reckon some of his players have turned into one.

Pre-Match View From Leeds,https://roysviewfrom.com/2020/09/25/pre-match-view-from-leeds-4/,2020-09-25,"“Personally quite like Wilder and what he has done with the Blades, overlapping cbs are cool. They are similar to us with their system being the key in general over the individual.But the loss of Dean Henderson is huge imo, he was vital to their form last season given they dont score much (only scored more than one goal in 8 or 9 league games i think).Not saying Henderson is solely responsible but without him it would have been a relegation battle for Blades imo.Now they have an inferior replacement and they still arent scoring.They are desperate for attackers imo, any side that relies on ageing lower league strikers like Sharp and McGoldrick plus McBurnie who hasnt looked up to it in the Prem so far will struggle for goals.Given there success was built on a fantastic young goalie and a well organised side (credit Wilder for that) i think they will find this season much harder.2nd season is always harder, they dont have the momentum of promotion and they are still relying on the system over individuals which is fine but they needed an exceptional individual last season and they dont have him now.Suppose the question is can the very clever Chris Wilder system cover for the loss of a very talented individual?Imo as things stand it will be very difficult, with 2 or 3 quality signings especially in the attacking positions though then very possibly.Blades are a well organised side defensively, we are very solid offensively.They dont score we cant stop conceding.”"

Everyone knows their physical MO but for some reason he sent out a formation that was easily overwhelmed in midfield – Wilder’s very well drilled journeymen playing to 110% of their ability made us look the load of soft Southern jessies (that we mostly are). Very curious for Potter as a coach with a reputation for selecting teams/formations to suit each game.So I see this as a one off game requiring a specific line-up and would play our big guys at the back, together with a combative midfield – with Alzate and Bernardo who can defend and also bomb forward.Sheff Utd will offer a very physical, direct, pressing game. We didn’t deal with Decoure running directly at 4-5 Albion players yesterday so we also need to show more grit and stand up to their physicality or we could get overwhelmed.”"

Pre-Match View From Leicester,https://roysviewfrom.com/2019/08/22/pre-match-view-from-leicester-2/,2019-08-22,"“Zaha is one of the easiest players to mark out of the game if the rest of Palace isn’t up to scratch, especially because he’s a winger – it was easy to mark him out as you did because of how shit the rest of the attack is. When they had Townsend on form and Batshuayi they had other threats which meant teams couldn’t focus on Zaha so much.”"

Pre-Match View From Leicester,https://roysviewfrom.com/2019/08/22/pre-match-view-from-leicester-2/,2019-08-22,“Sheff U remind me of us in earlier days with 3 centre halfs and a largely English/British squad. The difference with us is we had a few top players like Muzzy and Emile and some bruising big defenders where there game is not as physical with centre halfs acting as wingers! Its a real interesting formation and way to play and thats supported by some bang average players hunting down the ball like their lives depended on it. In theory we should have more than enough know how and ability to win here and I reckon that games like Chelsea will sharpen us up and the errors of today (timing of key passes) will be less against these.”
Pre-Match View From Leicester,https://roysviewfrom.com/2019/08/22/pre-match-view-from-leicester-2/,2019-08-22,"“These are a good side, but they play their best football when O’Connell and Basham can get on the overlap and confuse the opposition with overloads. Us playing three forwards high up the pitch could completely nullify that – get Barnes and Ayoze high and then it leaves Ricardo and Chilwell to ensure the wing-backs are pinned back.”"
Pre-Match View From Leicester,https://roysviewfrom.com/2019/08/22/pre-match-view-from-leicester-2/,2019-08-22,“Their centre back O’Connell looks a good player and was instrumental in the build up to the goal as they get their centre backs overlapping.

I don’t think that’s arrogant or overconfidence to say that. Sheffield United have started well and they’ll be difficult to beat but i’d be disappointed if we lose to a team with David McGoldrick and Billy Sharp up top. Defend well and I’d back us to break them down, i’d be less confident if we were playing them at home.”"

They seemed to have a bit of a beef with us over the 2 cup games in 2017-18.  They did extremely well to get promoted from a competitive league last season with fairly limited resources. Gonna be similar to a Burnley type game so we need a good start. Too often we go to these grounds and get sucker punched early on.”

It should be a good game, I’ve got massive respect for Sheff Utd to be fair, Wilder seems a top bloke and I’m glad he’s managed to get a chance in the Prem. He’s put together the kind of team you’d love as fan base, much like Pearson did with us “"

You’re in terms of the football they play, that’s why I said we have t be very careful to start well and not get sucked into their game, I’ve got a feeling Bramall Lane will be a nasty place to go this year.”"

With respect to Bournemouth and Palace I think this will be a tougher test as Wilder’s system could struggle against high-pressing sides (although to be fair it appears that most teams struggle against this). I think it will be a close but entertaining game. I hope Vardy gets a late winner just to see what his celebration looks like!!”

England’s pace will test Croatia and their direct style and set pieces isn’t something this Croat team has dealt with in this WC. On the other side, Croatia has a much better midfield than both Sweden and Colombia and has the ability to control that part of the pitch. They also have pace and direct goal threats out wide.The Croats also have the edge in experience but England are young and hungry, to me they look more likely to be the team playing to win. I think that’s where their edge lies.”"
Pre-Match View From Croatia,https://roysviewfrom.com/2018/07/09/pre-match-view-from-croatia/,2018-07-09,"“this match will be a real pleasure to watch because the both teams will attack and will play with passion.At my eyes, yes we need to be focus on some players. Especially Trippier on the right side, his runs, his calls and his delivery are always perfect. He was unknown before his arrival in the Tottenham squad but today, he’s one of the best offensive right back.Plus the Tottenham connection is hugely present in this team and we must to contain that, not let them to play and take confidence between them. With players like Alli, Dier, Kane, Trippier, Rose, or with Walker who was at Tottenham too.So Southgate will maybe play with the same line-up as he did in their past matchs during this world cup, with Pickford – Maguire, Stones, Walker – Young, Henderson, Alli, Lingard, Trippier – Kane, Sterling.With Delph, Rashford and Dier as replacement for Young, Sterling and Henderson.But yeah, as you said their set pieces are really dangerous and they’re all coming from Trippier.Now, this will be a real test for us because by the past, we had always some problems to play against this type of line-up (look at Mexico, who is playing the 3-5-2 too). And here the stamina aspect is at my eyes really important if we want to counter them because their players are fully fit and really fast with and without the ball. (Offensively and defensively).The key will be to see our midfield join the attack and not let our 3 strikers alone up front. We’ll need to play as a block and counter them as an unit. The croatian legs will be really heavy but this is our only chance to take a result from this match.Plus Harry Kane is actually my favorite player out of our NT, and we need to be really worried about him because we can’t let him 2cm front of him. This guy is clearly a lethal weapon and he is able to score with both foot, header, make the call, the right passes for his lads etc…This will be really tough for me to see our NT playing against some players from my favorite team who is Tottenham…”"

I watched two of their games partially, and on both their centre backs Stones and Maquire came flying in with thundering header goals. These two are big/strong and fearless in the air and we need to be ready.

They have not gone through the trials and tribulations. They do not have the chemistry and cohesion of our team. When the going gets tough in a pressure situation we do not know how this young team will respond and who will lead them out of the bad situations.2) Pekerman >Southgate. He knows the pulse of his team like a doctor and has “been there done that” when it comes to the World Cup knockouts.Southgate is still learning on the job how to be a Senior National team manager and may not know what to do in pressure situations.

Truth is that our players have yet to shine there as they have in other major leagues so less informed fans probably don’t realize the threat we possess. Davinson is just starting to make an impact there.The key to this match for them will be psychological. If you think we had a complex for years imagine being those guys – having the world’s most expensive and watched league in the world and yet having whole teams fielded without your players and struggling to have a major impact in international tournaments. They’ve struggled for years under the burden of that pressure and their media is awful to them.This is a VERY talented young English team and their youth and inexperience seems to have shielded them from the gloom that marked recent sides – but they are still kids and they play very aggressively. So far they’ve played two of the weakest teams in the tournament and then sat their stars when they had to play a real threat in Belgium. They are getting attacked by their own press as cowards – who knows how that effects them.The first 15 Ms of the game will be vital. If we could get an early goal we can get in their heads, but even moreso if we can hit them on counter well and get in their heads we’ve got a fine chance. We’ve already been through a crucible at the tournament and came through it – we have to make this game theirs and hope they can’t. I think Davinson will have great insight into marking Kane.

Everything points to a 0-3, but this is BWFC, and it is often when things look at their bleakest that good things happen..The article asks, “which Wanderers side would you pick”? Parky has a real job on here. It is a massive struggle for me to imagine a side we can play that can win. Wheater, Derik and Darby sound doubtful and given we have 2 games a week throughout September look likely to be out. Taylor sounds like he might be back. How about 4-4-1-1 and hope we can take advantage of their relative weakness in both boxes?”"

As sad as that might be the fact we can barely field a fit 11 against a side bang in form speaks for itself.Our midfield is dreadful at its best, but we’re really struggling now. I suspect that there will be a temptation to revert to a back three. Put Little right wing back and Taylor on the left. Stick Morais in Vela’s midfield role, Cullen and Karacan in front of the back four. Put ALF and Madine up front. Its the best I can do.

The two that we should be looking to get points off, we did so away from home. Also when Parky changed formation last season it took him a while to get them to make it work. Then it did and we went on a run. Obviously that’s harder this season but a run of at least looking like we are willing to scrap for it would be nice.Recently we’ve not looked like a Parky team. I wasn’t and never will expect flowing attacking football from teams he puts out, but organisation and fight should be a given.

Recent performance would suggest that we should have a guaranteed place in the second round – after all, United only lost 6 games in the entire 2016/17 season, and 2 of them were against us. To add insult to injury we also knocked them out of the Football League Trophy competition, with Amadou Bakayoko scoring one of our goals. At Burynwe had a grand total of 2 shots on target in the entire game, and you can’t expect to come away with 3 points with that kind of strike rate. Having said that, Sheffield United had those statistics on Saturday – 2 shots on target against Brentford, and a 1-0 home win … so it’s not just the quantity of shooting, it’s the quality, and again we are far from the finished article!”"

The Blades are already promoted and they have completely sold out their allocation of around 7300 tickets with several thousand more keen to come down to party and celebrate. I’m not sure about the exact rules on away team ticket allocations but surely this is an opportunity for us to open up another part of the ground and welcome these supporters to Stadium MK and in doing so gain more revenue. Of course this will mean more stewarding and maybe extra police, but so what, the cost will be more than offset by the revenue gained. Surely the powers to be can grant us permission to do this on the grounds that it will at least mean home and away fans will be segregated and by doing so avoid away supporters buying tickets in the home end, which apparently has already happened. Sheffield United is a massive club with a big fan base, these supporters are coming to celebrate, I very much doubt there will be any serious disorder.Not a completely straight forward situation, but common sense should prevail IMO.

On the main City forum I found this amusing description of a recent home defeat to Fleetwood. “In short, we were garbage. Second best from start to finish. I went home angry Saturday at bad defending and missed chances. Our defence was poor again with errors for the goals and other chances but we created sod all tonight. We were well beaten and they totally deserved to win. I cannot think of one player who won their individual battle and no one can come off saying they played well. We were well beaten by a committed and organised side who worked us out from the off and won the game at a canter. The thing that galled me was not the mistakes or the poor, pedestrian and predictable, totally non-penetrating football, but the lack of effort and not winning battles. The team did not look arsed tonight. That is a worry for a side top of the league. Hope it is a one off and we can get back to it in a few weeks but 4 or 5 will be fearing for their places after a total non-performance. Everything we have done well this season, good attitude, pressing, hassling and winning first and second balls, we failed to do. They were well organised, hungry and exposed our weaknesses. There were 5 clear chances in the game and they had them all. Sharp had a few half chances; mostly made himself but I cannot recall a really good chance we made all game. Granted most of their chances came from abysmal defending. It was really worrying how the heads dropped and we have gone in a few weeks from a confident side that suddenly players cannot wait to get rid of the ball and move it on. Noone was taking responsibility and the ball kept getting shuffled onto the next player. It was if no one wanted to make the mistake but inevitably someone did.”"

Pre-Match View From Walsall,https://roysviewfrom.com/2017/01/13/pre-match-view-from-walsall-5/,2017-01-13,"“From the back end of August to the end of November, the Blades had a 15-game unbeaten run of League One fixtures….then they lost at home to us. Since then they’ve played 6 League One games and won them all, and no doubt there will be an element of wanting to set the record straight when they come to the Banks’s on Saturday (it should also be remembered that we beat them 1-2 at Bramall Lane in October in the tin pot trophy). Their recent form has resulted in occupation of the top-of-the-table spot, 4 points clear of Scunthorpe United. According to the form book we don’t have a chance of even a point out of this one, but that’s also what the form book said about the two previous encounters. Not only are the Blades top of the table, they’re also very nearly top scorers in League One with an impressive 50 goals so far (compare that to our 26), and their defence has been boosted by on-loan Dingle Ethan Ebanks-Landell staying at Bramall lane until May – he also scored last week against Southend so is evidently one to watch. Unsurprisingly the Blades’ equivalent of UTS (S24SU) in their regular poll of game predictions overwhelmingly forecast an away win, although 8% of contributors actually reckoned we would score 2 goals!! No matter what JW tweaks for this one I can’t honestly see us getting 3 points out of it – I’ll be quite happy with a draw thank you very much. Whitney has been talking Simeon Jackson up this week (“the goals will come”) but for me a key decision will be whether he sees sense and plays Oztumer from the start. The extension of Jason McCarthy’s loan until the end of the season was good news, and presumably the week’s break for the squad will mean that any minor niggling injuries will have been cleared up. Matt Preston will be pushing for a start, and at the time of writing the situation regarding Scott Laird is still unclear”"

Never liked These lot and beating them again would be ace.The depressing thing about the story of our last twelve months is that this will be our second consecutive league game at home where the game plan will be about stifling the opposition and hoping we nick one and can shut up shop. A league that this time last year we were in with a genuine shout of winning by dominating the ball.I’d love Jon to confound both me and possibly the opposition by going for it. Oztumer and Morris to start so that front and back can join up with a goal threat being carried by the front four rather than just the full-backs.I’d heartily applaud Jon and the team off if it is a ding-dong game that we come off just a bit worse in (a 2-3 type affair).

I am personally of the opinion that we have a stronger squad than we have had for years, which is proven by the fact that many complain that we have quality players on the bench and not playing, but in fact we put a strong team out anyway in terms of our squad. This is better squad selection than people are giving credit for because if we get injuries and bans there are no emergency loans available now to strengthen mid season. They are a new squad and one would therefore expect them to play better together as the season progresses.”"

Of course it won’t. Our stated game-plan/strategy is to be hard to beat and play directionless balls to “beat the press”. Awful to watch and then wrenching to hear a post-match interview that will say “the game plan was going great until they scored”. Well of course it was!!

How different it might have been if this game had been scheduled for the start of the season – United lost three of their first four games and were firmly rooted to the foot of the table, but since then Chris Wilder seems to have found the magic touch and his Blades are currently undefeated in their last 15 League One games. The main unofficial website S24SU forum is already on page 2 for this game and the contributors are understandably very confident, but of course undefeated runs are there to be broken, aren’t they? …. current form:22 Oct Bradford City (A) Drew 3-329 Oct M K Dons (H) Won 2-113 Nov Chesterfield (A) Won 1-419 Nov Shrewsbury Town (H) Won 2-122 Nov Bury (H) Won 1-026 Nov Charlton Athletic (A) Drew 1-1It should also be mentioned that United are almost scoring for fun these days – in fact since their awful start in August they’ve scored in every League One game, with captain Billy Sharp currently top scorer with 12 goals to his name. He was rested for the FA Cup game against Leyton Orient, and United still managed to win 6-0 !!! Additional motivation (if it were needed) for United would be for them to show us what they can really do after we put them out of the Checkatrade Trophy.So, will it be “more of the same” from Jon Whitney? He is surely finding out what does, and does not, “gel” in his squad by now – and in this game more than most he is going to have to be extremely well prepared in terms of selection and tactics. Anything less could see a repeat of the Rochdale result because Sheffield United are no mugs (not at the moment, anyway, on a 15 game unbeaten run). We have scored 3 goals in our last 5 League One games and although it’s easy enough to say “play 2 up front” to increase the chances of scoring, would that result in a weakening of our defensive capabilities specially against the free-scoring opposition at Bramall Lane? Bakayoko surely deserves a chance at 90 minutes – after all, he knows where the net is on this ground, and perhaps with a partnership of Jackson or Makris (fed by Turkish Messi) we might have a look-in….. “"

Has he considered that some of the people he has been trying to tempt have taken one look at our tactics and lack of creativity and decided to go somewhere else…?? I have said this before, and I still believe this to be the case – the problem isn’t with the current squad, either in quality or numbers. What is a problem is that the shackles are on the team, and they are so busy trying to implement the ‘clean sheet’ mentality that we can’t attack with any purpose and as soon as the midfield starts to wobble the floodgates open up and we are shipping them in from everywhere. Fundamentally, unless there is a massive shift in thinking and tactics towards a ‘we need to score more goals than the opposition’ focus and stop worrying about conceding, we are relegation fodder. Much as it pains me to say that.”"

Their experience over the past few years almost mirrors that of Wigan Athletic – virtually unlimited funds for team building, a Premiership place, semi-finalists in Cup competitions, yet slipping down to League One status and only able to maintain a mid-table position. Sheffield United’s “sugar daddy” took the form of Prince Abdullah bin Mosaad bin Abdulaziz al Saud of the Saudi Royal family in September 2013, who promised substantial new capital with the aim of returning the Blades to the Premiership as quickly as possible. Nigel Adkins was appointed Manager last June, following quite a few well-known names holding that post – Neil Warnock, Micky Adams, Bryan Robson, Danny Wilson and Nigel Cough have all had a go without too much success.United currently sit in 13th place, 9 points away from the play-offs with only 7 games remaining. Billy Sharp leads their goalscorers with 17 to his name, followed by Che Adams with 9. One player of theirs will register with Saddlers’ supporters – Florent Cuvelier the Belgian midfielder.

Villa had won the league by losing at Arsenal so events at Bramall Lane that day were barely a footnote.There doesn’t seem to be a second of footage anywhere from that day which is amazing given how crucial the game was.Still – “we sent the Blades down” was a refrain that was heard around Fellows Park for years afterwards.”

It was thought that his time should have been spent solely as manager, without the distraction of being physio. This upset chairman Kevin McCabe, who wasn’t particularly impressed by Adkins’ work on the treatment table, after claiming he himself had not been right since  Adkins gave him a massage.“He just rubbed me up the wrong way, so I sacked him” said McCabe,This was the umpteenth time Adkins has been fired, and when asked if he was deterred by it Adkins said “No way, getting fired a lot just proves that I’m no quitter”. “"

Despite being one of the favourites for an automatic promotion spot (as they seem to be every year), United are currently in 8th place in the table on 24 points and their form hasn’t been anything to write home about under Nigel Adkins’ management. He was appointed in June and the size of his task was brought home to him at this season’s opening fixture when United were thumped 4-0 at Gillingham. Money to improve matters wouldn’t seem to be a problem – the club is 50% owned by a Saudi Royal Prince, and the squad is among the biggest in this league at 35 players. Current form is indifferent though:One familiar face I would have thought we might see in their line-up is Florent Cuvelier, but he hasn’t appeared in the flesh this season from what I can see. Perhaps he’s injured, or loaned out – no doubt a friendly Blade can inform us. Leading scorers this season are Billy Sharp and Che Adams (7 and 6 goals respectively). In the League, they’ve scored two fewer goals than ourselves but have shipped eight more than we have and I would hope that as long as our international squad return fit and raring to go, we should be able to gather another three points with, say, a 2-0 scoreline.”"

Only 31 games(32 with our inevitable first round FA Cup exit) until the end of the season. Count down is well and truly on. As for Sheff U, they are a baffling team. Seem to vary between excellent and terrible, with nothing in between. They seem quite suseptible to a dodgy result, but when they turn up they bury teams. Got a lot of decent players at this level, including Sharp who is back amongst the goals. Adams(who we chased last season) is scoring, but he too seems to score in fits and starts. Defence looks ropey, they’ve only conceded 3 less than us which is a bit mad. But a decent team on their day.Its at home, so we’ll probably lose. All United have to do is press us for a concerted period(first half, 2nd half, it makes no difference) and wait for their golden chances to arrive. Maybe we might scrape out a 0-0, but I doubt it. Oh the joys, roll on Saturday. “"
Pre-Match View From Crewe,https://roysviewfrom.com/2015/10/30/pre-match-view-from-crewe-2/,2015-10-30,"“The Chronicle’s fan opinion piece was laughable this week. Saying how we should be grateful we have a club to support. That’s right, you just keep happy clapping us all the way to the Conference under the unsackable Steve Davis. Another mentioned he’s had no money to spend, well when he had money he wasted it on crap, then after his spending sprees, he’s sold no players for a decent amount of money since Murph and he’s had no cup income whilst we’ve failed on the pitch and faced relegation past two seasons and this one, he went over-budget last season when his permanent signings once again failed so how can he expect money when he hasn’t used it wisely in the first place? The fact a sizable minority of fans would rather us fail with Davis rather than change and see what happens sums up the pathetic mentality of some of our fans. In their eyes, as long as the town has a football club they’ll clap and never protest even if we go down with a record low points total because we’re a “special” club with a “stable and secure board and although it’d be nice if the board could tell us things now and again I have every ounce of trust in them.”. That’s what I saw one fan say, I wonder what would happen if his bank manager decided to withhold details of where the money was going in his accounts? Would he trust them then? No, so why does he trust this board and management to get our current predicament right?When we’re in the Conference, these happy clappers will be the first to say “I wish we’d sacked Davis earlier to give ourselves half a chance of surviving in the league.” and it’ll happen. And those fans would fully deserve to watch us playing pub teams in the Conference. Shame those who want a bit of pride and excitement in the club are the ones who are going to suffer in the near future. “"

Not just missing the point but wanting mediocrity over anything else. “cos we are Crewe”.This…“We are Crewe fans. We have bought into the ‘Crewe way’ when we could have been attracted to the bright lights.”Is exactly what is wrong with the club. This idea we are special, on a pedestal. No no no. It was something when we were virtually mid-table in the Championship. When we’re free falling through the league with huge irreparable cracks forming in the foundations of the club, “the Crewe way” is sod all of a reason for blind loyalty.”"

It’s funny how everyone bleats about the Crewe Way when our rivals have survived two administrations in a decade and are higher than us in the league, with a higher budget, no huge player sales for years and only marginally higher gates. The Crewe Way is now having one shot on target per game and hoof and hope for a 0-0. Surely a sensible football fan would want to protest and demand answers from the board as to how this dramatic regression is even possible? But no, it’s the Crewe Way, you buy into it because we’re a special sustainable football club that’s regressing into non-league obscurity and if we don’t like it then we can fuck off to Vale Park in the eyes of our “real fans”. “"

Hence why Davis needs to be sacked urgently.”“Just a feeling someone is going to absolutely batter us at some point (Strange that it’s not actually happened yet, scoreline wise).

It is taking a long time but we were still in the Unibond league in 2002.The club is run correctly at a profit by our long serving chairman Ben Robinson and looking at if from a wider aspect it is probably very good for English football that we continue to achieve as we do.Everybody seems to think JFH will jump ship as soon as any big club comes calling but I’m not so sure that is the case. Sure eventually a really big club will come in for Jimmy and he will go, he is destined for the top, of that I have absolutely no doubt. But Jimmy chose Burton Albion for his first job in English football for reasons very important to him. He picked his chairman, how the club is run and the vast community projects run by the clubs community trust plus the family values the club stands for all were a good match for Jimmy’s values and principals.Regarding this season, I never ever thought we could reach the championship, of course its very early days yet but we are top and maybe the unthinkable is possible. I have seen nothing to frighten us football wise, other clubs in this division maybe have some better quality players than we do but we have an organised team and a game plan masterminded by JFH and David Oldfield, we have belief, ambition and superb team spirit allied to a lot of ability.We may well fall flat on our face at some stage but I seriously doubt it, the club are going to give it everything we have got, I like what the players say, ” we aren’t playing the size of the club, its history or supporters but the 11 players on the pitch representing that club”.For a supporter like me with nearly 50 seasons under his belt its dreamland at present, I am going to enjoy the ride home and away and see where it takes us.”"

Been to Bramall Lane once in 2006 league cup game when we were unlucky to lose. Would love 1000+ Shakers there and I will be one of them but can’t see beyond a routine home win.

Anyway a few of them did but for no extended length of time, don’t recall Cooper coming across at all. The only person who lingered was Yas but he’d (a) just been given MoM and (b) saw a couple of guys with an Iraqi flag in our end – if he’d found a couple of his countrymen 1000s of miles from home, can’t blame him really.

However, I would love to see us go for it at Bramall Lane like we did when we were 2-0 down 2 years ago and then get one over Nigel Clough though, what a bitter little man he is. That 3-3 game was one of the best Crewe games I’ve ever seen.Post match, our tactical genius of a manager will then go on to say this was a bonus game and we need to be realistic when playing a side like Sheffield United despite the abysmal form Sheffield United are in, only scraping past a poor Port Vale side thanks to a penalty. He’ll then give the inevitable ‘I’m confident of staying in the division’ to the press.Least Harry Maguire isn’t playing in this game, 3 goals in 2 games for him at Bramall Lane against us”"
