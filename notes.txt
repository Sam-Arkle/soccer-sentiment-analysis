Genereal notes here for the project. Decisions made, things todo

The roys sitemap is probably a better place to visit in order to get to the prematch urls. 

Will be difficult to get the fan views as individuals, rather than a big blob prior to a given match. This may have an 
impact on sentiment analysis. 

Only looking at one team for 9 years, so only getting roughly 5000 comments, may not be enough




Future developments:
- Scrape from s24su to get the pre match sentiment from sufc fans. 
- Obvious issue for Roy's view: it is a cultivated list, it isn't necessarily representative of the general concensus.
- Get post match comments and see if that is useful (does pre-match sentiment indicate post-match? 
Could we get a measure of how pessimistic the fanbase is?)
- 


Comment scraping notes: 
Collecting URL for validation, team name and published date to match with the actual game, and comment. 
Could arguably not capture url but for now it is the safest bet. 
- Could store a comment per data entry or nest the comments on a per page basis. For now I'll go with 
one comment per data entry and we'll see if that bites us later.
