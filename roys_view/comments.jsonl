The Championship is far better as a\u00a0competitive league where all teams and matches can have such a marked impact on each\u00a0other. Gone are the so many matches in the Premiership that almost need not be played because the results are\u00a0foregone conclusions.

I think in Sheffield United you have a team that know they\u2019re realistically down, but with so much of the season left to play they are playing for dignity and actually playing quite freely, from what I watched.

Brewster has proven to be a completely ineffective signing for the Premier League, perhaps a naive signing when it\u2019s clear to most observers that they needed more proven, experienced quality up front. Against Liverpool yesterday they could and should have scored at least a couple of goals. They didn\u2019t and that\u2019s their problem.

Very low on confidence, a few sending offs, concentrating on the league survival so maybe wont risk they key players. BUT\u2026 they are premier league standard and such we shouldn\u2019t take too much notice of the \u2018weak\u2019 parts of their game. You would expect them to be a physical side that are well drilled and with the overlapping centre back tactics, not many managers would have come against that before, so we need to be aware and exploit space where ever we can. Tis will enjoy this one as he loves playing against sides where we his team are the underdogs. Imagine he can get us raring to go in this match. You only have to look at the Sheffield united squad to remind yourselves of the quality they possess (current international players (at the highest level), past international players, future international players!) Solid manager and tactition who has come unstuck this term in the Prem but previously bossed the leagues and produced excellent results. This one will be tough, very tough. \u201c"}

Which is somewhat true. But it has gone a bit under the radar that they have spent a reasonably amount of money since coming up. They spent 64m last season, and 56m according to Transfermarkt. That\u2019s with very little recouped in sold players. In the same period we have bought 52m and 35.2m respectively, and received 24.5m and 23.6m. Of course, we have built up a more developed squad over a number of seasons, and that the money that they have spent is still little compared to most other sides. But I think it would surprise people how much they have spent and a 1 point return is pretty dreadful for that outlay.\u00a0I think we will win this one. We have scored in all EPL games this season except the opening game and have scored 2 goals in a match 8 times. Ings back, Che looks the business, JWP freekick\u00a0threat, and even Vestegaard threat off set pieces and I think we should be okay scoring a couple.\u00a0I look at Sheffield United\u2019s attack and think, will they score 1, let alone 2 against us? Probably not in all honesty unless the defense does something dumb (Bednarek I\u2019m looking at one of your little air swings).\u00a0Especially if Vestegaard plays like how he did Monday night.\u00a0It\u2019ll be tough, they will fight and scrap.

The, \u2018if he were any good he would force his way into the team\u2019 is ridiculous. Mane, Salah, and Firmino (who performs a specific role) are world-class in their positions so you can count on one hand the players that would push their way into the team ahead of them. So that makes Brewster a squad player. Origi is a seasoned pro so minutes here and there from the bench are going to do him no harm, he has developed as much as he is going to. Brewster is in his formative years, he needs games."}

Maybe this time a spade is a spade and we do actually want to develop the player. As we\u2019ve seen we aren\u2019t flush with cash so we need to look for solutions from within the club. Loan him out and see how he does. If it doesn\u2019t work out, fine, but Brewster after his showing last year, his pre-season, and the fact he came off a major injury that cost him a year of development deserves the benefit of the doubt.\u201d"}

In Lampard\u2019s year he came from nowhere (well Swindon via the under 23s) to be our first choice right back. Lampard\u2019s team and tactic played to his strengths. Breaking forward a lot, providing an outlet. Driving from right back into the box and providing crosses. He was excellant. He\u2019s had a poor season. It feels like he\u2019s been asked to defend more and his headers seem to be into the middle of the park to a waiting opponent (should someone tell him to head it back where it came from?). Managing that kind of thing can be taught. For me Bogle as still a class act. His brilliant debut season makes him a premier league quality full back and in the right forward thinking team mid table team (sheff u, wolves Leicester etc), he would be a great asset\u201d"}

A repeat of the 1-0 win we achieved against the Blades in the 2009 Play Off Final would suit for a variety of reasons. Not least of which is Nick Pope\u2019s pursuit of the Golden Glove where he holds a narrow lead over Alisson of Liverpool, Ederson of Manchester City and of course Dean Henderson. Burnley are in great form having picked up 21 points in their last 10 League games. Sheffield United suffered two successive 3-0 defeats against Newcastle and Manchester United on the resumption before returning to winning ways with a 3-1 win over Spurs last time out. The Blades will probably stick to their tried and trusted system of three centre halves combined with overlapping fullbacks. For Burnley Jay Rod, Chris Wood, JBG and Robbie Brady have all returned to training. Of these I expect Rodriguez (if declared fit) to start up front with Vydra. The fixture may come a little too soon for the other 3 to feature. Jack Cork went off injured at Selhurst Park so Pieters may be asked to continue in the left of midfield berth.\u201d"}

Potter had obviously spotted how Sheff U aren\u2019t really a great team with the ball, just one who win all the 2nd balls, throw themselves into tackles and show a never give up attitude in how they close down everything. But in technical terms they are not great. So we went there and tried to force them to play by sitting back and allowing them time on the ball. They couldn\u2019t invent much other than crosses in which our back 3 did very well in dealing with. Could\u2019ve nicked a win had Dunk scored but it\u2019s very evident we\u2019re too good to go down.\u201d"}

And from Sheffield I have the feeling that it is such a typical English mid-engine that loves the more physical play.

That he had doubts about that in the summer was normal, now half a year later you can indeed see that it can be a right choice. In any case a better choice than taking the step to a club like Liverpool.\u201d"}

Ever since Snoddy bent that one in in the last minute and he had nothing but kind words toward us. Very similar to Deano in being a down to earth, honest manager. Probably because both love their clubs and wouldnt bullshit their own fans. The game itself is a test of character. You know you have to match them for fight and tactical discipline; then hope your quality will shine through. This could be season changing for us if we could do it. \u201c"}

It is not a  high scoring side. Their strength entirely lies in their ability to  close ranks in the back and catch teams too high up. Sheffield Uniteds problem on the other hand is that they will be playing  a side that is just as hard to score on as they are. Key difference is  that our strikers are vastly better, and are finally hitting form. We\u2019re the favorites in this match, but we should not make the assumption  that this will be easy, because it will certainly be a tight game,  unless the floodgates somehow open. \u201c"}

Having said that, I actually think they may struggle if they get a few iffy results. Their players are playing well above themselves, thriving on the confidence and momentum they have. I thought they were poor after we scored today and they did the same against United last week. Unlike when we were promoted, it was clear we had Premier League quality players. McGoldrick, as just one example \u2013 but there are many more in that team \u2013 is not Premier League quality. He is a perennial Championship loan man, but absolute credit to him and his manager for what they have achieved this season (so far), but I do fear for them when the going gets tough.\u201d  \u201cSUFC, like us last season, were an absolute credit to promoted teams from the champo. Some of their football today was very good and they might count themselves unlucky not to have been out of sight before we got the equaliser. Although, has to be said, they were very cynical with their off the ball stuff. Sad to see that creeping more and more into the game and, ironically, a tactic used by teams managed by Englishmen, SUFC today, Bournemouth last week. Remember the days when we used to frown upon the Italians and South Americans playing like that? Referee bottled a clear second yellow and therefore sending off for the SUFC right wing back, who must have watched old videos of foreign teams from the 70s and 80s with that off the ball on Jota, in the second half. Anyway, that\u2019s not to distract from how well they played.\u201d \u201cYou can see how Blades got themselves out of the Championship and why they\u2019re giving Prem sides a problem, they have the classic components that you would look for in a newly promoted side \u2013 fast, in your face, direct (which is not to say they lacked some skill as they didn\u2019t), a physical edge that borders on brutal/cynical, very well organised and they work as a unit very well.

Like us they will stay up as they\u2019re decent at both ends. Respect Wilder plenty and he really makes that 3-5-2 work. Of course they can knock it long when required but they are also very capable of playing quick 1-2s out wide quickly which means with their overloads their wide players get plenty of space to get crosses in. They build up plenty of corners from that tactic and eventually they score from one. We\u2019ve also struggled defending against them in last two seasons.

Like Norwich, they are sometimes going to press high, but Norwich wanted to play a wide game, Sheffield are a lot more narrow, a lot of longer balls hoping for one of the strike partnership to get a flick-on to the other.

I would say their system worked against Chelsea, but did not against Everton, result notwithstanding. Everton seemed more aware of where the space was available, they were just dire at actually using it. Chelsea was more determined to batter through the middle I think. On the attack, Sheffield struggled to get much going against Everton (in part I think because they had a lead for over half the game, so were more cautious). Their scheme seems to rely on a flaring run from one of the two strikers, with long balls aimed wide, outside the 18 yard box and in the zone between the 18 and half line. The other striker shifts over and makes an interior run, one of the midfielders always runs into the space that striker vacates, and sometimes one of the other 3 mids makes a supporting run. That worked much more effectively against Chelsea than Everton, ironically."}

We have more individual quality but Sheffield United have players that know their responsibilities and have a compact and solid 5-3-2 which Liverpool struggled to break down at the weekend. They are narrow and have 2 holding midfielders which makes it hard to play between the lines so I think we would be best off attacking them down the wings, therefore I would like to see us play Sarr on the right and Deulofeu on the left.\u201d"}

Huddersfield  and Cardiff both made good fists of their first seasons in the Premier  League and Burnley, whose squad has similarites with The Blades, are  practically established in the top flight now. Sheffield  United are arguably a bigger club than any of those mentioned above  with a history and tradition that dates back to winning the old First  Division in 1898 and scoring the first goal of the Premier League era,  Brian Deane against Manchester United in 1992.  Wilder will want to give his heroes a chance in the Premier League but  realistically he\u2019ll also need six signings, most of them with some  experience at the highest level.  Wilder likes 3-5-2 and there is no suggestion he\u2019ll change the format  after promotion. Up front he can\u2019t rely on Sharp to match this season\u2019s  tally of 24 goals, and may try to make the loan moves of Cardiff\u2019s Gary  Madine and Scott Hogan from Aston Villa permanent.  On the upside, if the ownership issue is settled, Wilder may have more  pulling power, though he won\u2019t want to wreck the spirit within in the  dressing-room that has got them this far. \u201c"}

But I\u2019ve always been one that if we do achieve a bit of success, we have to enjoy it.Players need to let their hair down, especially when they achieve something as memorable as what we have this year. The scenes on Sunday were something special and will stay with me and the players for a long, long time.\u201d In an interview during Sunday\u2019s  promotion party, Wilder took aim at the \u201cmuppets from Leeds\u201d, including  Patrick Bamford, who had questioned how the Blades would cope with the  promotion pressure.He explained: \u201cEmotions were high and we\u2019d had a couple of drinks, but that\u2019s how it is and that\u2019s how I am.\u201cI am old school and when people open their mouth and say things, they have got to expect stuff to come back.\u201cBut it\u2019s nothing personal.

The last two United sides  promoted to the top flight \u2013 Dave Bassett\u2019s team of 1989-90 and Neil  Warnock\u2019s 2005-06 version \u2013 had talent but got by more on perspiration  than inspiration. Wilder was part of that Bassett squad, hence those  nights out and fountain plunges, but his team are anything but direct.  It was fitting that for their first goal in the promotion-clinching win over Ipswich on Saturday the assist came from Jack O\u2019Connell, overlapping on the left. From centre-back. Much of the credit for the team\u2019s style of play should also go to  Wilder\u2019s assistant, Alan Knill. While Wilder was talking through his  haircut routine, you can picture Knill quietly peering out at the  celebrating throng from the shadows and making mental notes about how  crowd patterns might be applied to set-piece routines. After the win  against Ipswich Wilder, not for the first time, had to shove Knill  physically towards the Bramall Lane Kop who were singing his name. Their  combination of fire and ice seems to work perfectly.Squad depth has made a crucial difference. The moment last season\u2019s  campaign was derailed can be pinpointed to the broken leg suffered by  the key midfielder Paul Coutts at Burton in November, but this season  the Blades have coped admirably with the bumps in the road \u2013 not least  in the two wins over Easter, achieved without their injured captain and  top scorer Billy Sharp, who returned for a third spell at the club in  2015 and, 89 goals in 175 games later, has firmly established his place  in United folklore.Whether this squad can add another chapter by surviving next season  can wait. For now they can look forward to a summer of anticipation, a  Premier League campaign and, in the next week or two, perhaps another  sparkling oration from Wilder on the city hall steps.\u201d"}

Uncompromising defending is the bedrock, but Wilder is a canny  tactician, with the use of over-lapping centre-backs to overload the  opposition this season proving highly effective. Old fashioned team  spirit is a prerequisite in Wilder\u2019s dressing room, but when it comes to  modern-day strategy, he will not be left behind.\u201d"}

I\u2019m nervous, but not as nervous as the away game this season as I was  adamant we\u2019d get pumped, now we have Brucey in charge we have a great  chance, I just hope we play with the same intensity as Tuesday, for me  that was a great performance & I think we have to be at that level  if we want to win as we all know how much they\u2019ll be up for it with  Wilder & also the fact they have the full LL end now!\u201d"}

Equally, he recognises that we are a threat and that his bunch will need to find a way to win.

I do find it funny United were time-wasting, and their fans were singing that \u2018take your time Sheffield United\u2019 song, considering that them time-wasting was fine by us. A draw is a much better result for us than it is them, as it means they haven\u2019t gained any ground on us. Particularly considering our favourable run of games after Leeds next week. Not the brightest bunch are they. Best moment of the match though had to be Zimmermann shoving Billy Sharp straight to the ground off the ball, and then Sharp getting up and tryna square up to him before realising he barely comes up to Zimmermann\u2019s shoulder\u201d"}

Confidence dropped, some injuries, and lack of chance to settle into a  side geared up for him have done the rest. Now he\u2019s behind Tammy  Abraham, ( obviously ) and offers nothing new. Even with Dean Smith  here, he\u2019s evidently not impressing well enough in training. I don\u2019t  like to see players struggle or fail so I hope he does do well \u2013 aside  from where it hinders Villa obviously \u2013 elsewhere, but I suspect he  peaked and was sold when his value was at it\u2019s highest\u201d"}

We have played them twice since that 3-0 win in 2007 (prior to which, we had greeted our returning European Cup winners 25 years after they were crowned Champions of Europe). We lost 1-2 in a 2014 FA Cup tie and then drew 2-2 last season having been 2-0 up within the first 10 minutes. Overall we have won 59 and drawn 30 of the 125 league games between the two clubs. The Blades are founder members of the Football League and have been champions once in 1897-98. They have won the FA Cup 4 times in 1899, 1902, 1915 and in 1925. They have been outside of the top flight since 2007 and were in League One from 2011 until 2017. They are currently 11 points above us and a point nearer to the automatic promotion places (3) than we are to the play off spots (4). We really need to win this one, if only as pay back for the embarrassing 1-4 defeat we suffered at Bramall Lane 4 months ago. A win would see them on top of the league at the end of the game. A win for us would see us move within a point of sixth place.\u00a0 Let\u2019s make it a comfortable win and another clean sheet for us, so that we can begin the weekend in style and with a wide smile.\u201d"}

They play a system bit like what we did in that 4 month epic spell under Roberto when we went from garbage to world beaters almost over night but instead of having the left and right of the front wide they play more of a triangle with a main pairing and one behind. So i think the 4-1-4-1 we used in the first half against Swansea would be a sensible way to go as they are very fluid in their shape so we will need to control the midfield if we want to have any hope of getting a result.\u201d"}

Hope the reports are true and he is in the team for the Israel match would be a great decision.

Every Sheffield United fan I\u2019ve come across would tell you that Norwood is the difference in their midfield and is the key to their season so far. If you watched the Sheffield derby the other day, then you\u2019d have seen it reflected pretty clearly there. Fleck quietly got on with the job and did ok. Everything impressive and incisive came from Norwood. So Fleck\u2019s not even a class above the midfielders at his own club, let alone the rest of the league. Is he better than Grealish? no. Is he better than Hernandez? no. Leitner? no. Joe Allen? no. Jota? no. Is he playing better than 8 goal callum robinson? no. How about 8 goal Che Adams? nope. You can easily make the case for McGinn.. 2 goals, 4 assists to Flecks 1 and 1. I could go on, but i\u2019m sure everyone\u2019s already bored and gets the point. Fleck hasn\u2019t had a call because center mid has generally been one of the stronger areas of the side for us. I doubt anyone would drop Armstrong, Cairney or McGregor for him. Probably not McGinn either. Most would agree that Christie deserves a call, having not done too bad in the few outings he\u2019s had and his recent form is great both domestically and internationally. Then add in that we basically need to have 2 defensive mids in the squad, and that puts Fleck at best 7th in line for a call, probably 8th.. at best.!\u201d"}

Adams shouldn\u2019t really be up for discussion since he\u2019s a completely different player but player wise, yes I confidently believe he\u2019s better than him. Again he deserves his call up and is more quality available to us on the bench.\u201d"}

They don\u2019t have a defensive mid. Their entire system is build around being dynamic and players swapping and moving. The midfield 3 of Duffy, Norwood and Fleck all go forward and back, wide and narrow. From what I\u2019ve seen of them Fleck tends to stay in a fairly neutral area, looking to move the ball laterally. Norwood drops deeper to do defensive work, distribute with long balls, and Duffy makes runs ahead a lot of the time. But they\u2019re a very fluid 3, who seems to have a good understanding. Go back 2 season to when Fleck was probably performing better than he is now, and he had Coutts in along side him who was the defensive midfielder. Fleck is somewhat akin to Bannan in that he sometimes plays deeper, but he\u2019s not a defenisve mid, in no world would you want either of them to be the shield ahead of your back 4 and they\u2019re not fighting for squad spots with the likes of McDonald, Shinnie or McTominay. \u201c"}

Stepped up to the championship and dropped to 8. Now he\u2019s 1/3rd of the way thru the season and has 1. Is it just a change in system that means he\u2019s passing to overloading players who are then getting the assists? Norwood and Duffy have a few more, so is Fleck the pass before the assist now? Trying to understand why he\u2019s playing better but his numbers have disappeared. Why has no one come in for him? Certainly scouts have been at the lane a fair bit, hence Brooks move. But it seems like Fleck\u2019s not really been on anyones radar as far as I can tell from press. If he\u2019s as good as is being suggested, then why\u2019s he still at the blades? I will give Fleck credit tho. He left Rangers, started at the bottom and worked his way up. Wasn\u2019t always easy, I remember seeing him for Coventry against Leyton Orient a few years back and he was absolutely honking. Among the worst players on the pitch, nothing worked for him at all. But clearly he\u2019s got his head right and worked hard and is not in a much better place playing to a much better standard. So well done to the man. \u201c"}

They were happy to sit deep and let us come at them and I could see a goal coming for us as we started to knock it around a bit better. A few good crosses, a few half chances but it was all soooooooo slooooooow at times.\u00a0 Their first goal was a\u00a0 corner flicked in the near post for an OG by CM. The replay showed a clear foul on NM right behind Mepham as he was dragged to the ground and it should have been disallowed but I think we have let too many in from set pieces to grasp at that straw too long. \u00a0Their\u00a0 second goal was a wicked deflection, their third a quick throw, Barbet is not looking, a pull back from the byline and there is the big number 9 in acres of space on the penalty spot to pick his spot, not one Bees midfielder within 25 yards of it again. This was possibly SU\u2019s only chance of that half until Barbet gave it away on the edge of their area and left us 2v1 and JM took one for the team and probably should have walked .Sheff U midfield ran all night and chased everything. I am not trying to make out we were anything other than disjointed and broken men all over the pitch but we gifted them three goals tonight, created more opportunities than them and possibly could have seen their first goal chalked off and had a penalty ourselves and bought a win that could have lifted us, but we didn\u2019t.\u201d"}

Expectation is that Sheffield will win fairly comfortably especially as it\u2019s a home game on the telly and Reading just don\u2019t really do very well in league games at home on the telly in recent years. However Reading\u2019s overall form in play is very slowly on the turn into something better so if Reading get it right and Sheffield don\u2019t there could be happy outcome for the beleaguered followers of the hoops. Sheffield United had a good start but, fortunately, it would appear that now is the best time of the season so far to play them as they have only recorded 2 wins from their last 8 games. However both of those wins were against currently struggling sides (Wigan and Brentford) while the 3 defeats they\u2019ve suffered in the same run have all been against promotion contenders (Forest, Derby and Leeds). As ever Reading\u2019s opponents are injury free while Reading\u2019s injury list is still as bad as ever. So another hard game awaits then.

McGoldrick was a real threat in the box from well delivered crosses, supported by Washington/Sharp (any of these three would walk into our team), and they had a big team attacking well-taken set pieces. Defensively they got numbers back when we slowly moved the ball forward, and I couldn\u2019t see us breaking them down in open play at any point.

We were running around with our tongues hanging out. Their McGoldrick was coming short, linking the play, turning into us and pulling some of the strings and we were finding it tough to get the ball. For the first fifteen minutes it looked as if it could have been a real afternoon to forget. Their Sharp was running all over the place.\u00a0They ran hard to try and get back into it. They had a lot of help from the ref who was made of regular brown stuff. Right in front of us he gave two free kicks which were completely wrong. Gregory was totally baffled by the first and second which looked like firm challenges on Sharp who could fall over after the slightlest of contacts. Neither of those ref\u2019s errors led to a goal so he gave them another chance. Some slick passing saw a cross into our six yard box and McGlodrick tucked it away.\u201d"}

Totally lost in space for Exeter\u2019s first two goals when a real midfielder would\u2019ve been defending.

Don\u2019t know whether to be angry at the team or what because we played so well in general in that second half. Defensively disciplined and should\u2019ve won it with the chances we had, Leitner\u2019s being the stand-out. Obviously no-one expected him to match the number of goals Maddison got last season but he simply has to be converting chances like that. At the very least he had Hernandez to his left just knock it to him and he has an open goal. Overall Leitner wasn\u2019t at his best. The rest though all superb. Tettey and Trybull absolute warriors, Hernandez too good for Sheffield United\u2019s backline, Rhodes looking dangerous, Pukki I like more with each game, Jamal looked like he hadn\u2019t been away, Klose in particular at the back was solid, Krul looked reliable.

The last time we played at Bramall Lane Leon played for them and we lost a very poor game 1-0.

Everybody looked up for it and was getting their foot in, closing down and denying them space. But they were up for it big time too. There was lots of good movement in the middle, people running off the ball, going wide and putting crosses in but we defended stoutly. They probably had slightly the better of the first half with chances. The ones of note was some close control by their 9 Clarke and a decent shot from 25yards which Archer saved well. We had a decent header from Cooper and some good attacking play but it came to nothing and ended all square at the break.The second half was a different story. They came out all guns blazing and pressed us back from the start. They stretched us this way and that and really our us under pressure. Their best chance came from a cross from the left which their bloke headed from 6 yards and Archer pushed it over for a corner. It was real Gordon Banks stuff. We had some decent movement forward with a great ball to Gregory from Morison on the right. He ran into the box and should have pulled the trigger but he squared it and it came to nothing. Then it was their turn. A good ball to their Clarke went off with a firm challenge from Hutch. It looked a goal kick but the ref deemed it to be a corner. We didn\u2019t clear it very well and their winger swung it in from the left, it was headed back across goal and Clarke nodded it in from three yards. Their mob went nuts. But their joy didn\u2019t last long. From the kick off it went back to Cooper who swung it forward into their box. It sailed over the head of their defended and Morison met it on the full and side footed it wide of their keeper for the equaliser. It was our turn to go nuts. We brought on Fred for a tiring Marshall but he did very little. Elliott came on for the last two minutes to replace Gregory and had a couple of touchesThere were two shouts for a penalty at each end. Their forward got booked for diving and ours could have gone either way. And so it ended an exciting draw\u2026.which I would have taken at one o\u2019clock.Archer made three world class saves which kept us in it and got my MOM. Romeo was very strong and focussed and Meredith was his normal aggressive and energetic self. Hutch and Cooper were rocks at the back but had their work cut out all afternoon. Wallace was lively and threatening and both Saville and Wallace were busy and solid. Marshall played well but didn\u2019t have too many opportunities to shine. Gregory had his normal busy game and one chance which he should have made more of. Morison showed his class with a deft finish for the goal.\u201d"}

Keeping the wingbacks pegged back in a defensive role should be a top priority, which means pace on the wings, forcing Baldock and Stevens to keep tight to them and be hesitant to join the attack. Without them united have very little width from what I\u2019ve seen of them, so Robinson and Barkhuizen on the wings is a must in my opinion, with Bodin either benched or played centrally.\u00a0 O\u2019Connell, Basham, and Stearman are all around 6\u20193\u2033 so we\u2019ll have no luck with the long balls forward we resort to at times, so keeping the ball on the ground is an absolute must as I doubt we\u2019ll win many duels. Set pieces will pose a problem too, as we\u2019ve been weak defending them recently and having tall centre halves and the likes of Leon Clarke and Clayton Donaldson attacking the ball will be very dangerous. \u2018m expecting a few goals for both sides in this one.

Boro got out of their mini slump and beat Karankas toothless troops 2-0 thanks to goals from Daniel \u201cCR7\u201d Ayala and Downing. We keep our place in the play offs but Milwall are somehow keeping up the pressure. Our next game is already on tuesday night as we go to fellow play off contenders Sheffield United in the first of a number of \u201c6 pointers\u201d. United lost their last game 2-3 away at Barnsley despite leading 2-1 with 25 minutes to go. United are in bad shape at the moment and have only won 1 game in 7 which was at home againt the mighty Burton 5 games ago. They are trailing Boro by 4 points so the onus is on them to attack us. That might free up some space for Traore, Downing, Howson and Bamford on the break which is likely the tactics Pulis will employ.They seem a bit nervous about the game knowing that a loss or maybe even a draw could end their season. They know they are not in great form and their defence isn\u2019t getting much praise. If the players are thinking along those lines too I predict a very tactical game and probably only one goal in it. We really need to get at them and not let their confidence grow. They are in a bad shape and we need to rattle them from kick off.\u201d"}

They started the season brilliantly but have tailed off a little over recent weeks which has seen them fall to the fringes of the play off race. However, that compared to Reading is obviously vastly superior even though they\u2019ve only managed 4 wins in their last 14 league games (compared to Reading now on a run of 1 win in 13 league games). The Blades have also lost both their last 2 league away games without scoring.Chris Martin will regain availability for this one while John Swift maybe in line for a recall.

Look at what Lobsterman Carlos Carvalhal is doing up at Swansea? A fantastic job, and it proves that there are a few tactical managers back in the championships that could do a better job than your Sam Alyerdice\u2019s. Slavisa is used to working on small budgets, and that gives him a great advantage over those big spenders who get duff information on overrated players. It only takes 1 or 2 flop players to put managers in the sack race. Remember Chris Houton back up at Norwich in the prem a few years back? 1 Van Winkle who was overrated, and Chris had the chance to get Wilfred Bony, and he chose Winkle, who got him the sack. At any level, you have to make good calls and good decisions. Slavisa made a good call when he got Mitro on board. I have no doubt tht this Fulham squad could make mid table comfortably back in the prem. Slavisa, i am confident would be better than Koeman and that other Dutch guy who got sacked. Like i said, only intelligent people, and intelligent chairmen like those at Swansea make good calls and decisions!!!\u201d"}

It has been an impressive season for last years League one winners, helped by Billy Sharpe, who a few weeks ago became one of the only three players to score 200 goals in the English league this century."}

I fear it\u2019ll be tough on Tuesday night as we enter that part of the season where some teams have a lot to play for, and others (like ourselves I am pleased to say) are destined for mid table, and can\u2019t really do much to change that. Surely we now want to see out the season without any major injuries, whilst giving as much game time and experience to the likes of Eze and Smyth."}

They would have beaten us if they\u2019d had their first choice midfield available. Whenever they lose it\u2019s always down to them being one or more short in midfield. Admittedly, this argument is going to be more difficult to pull-off now they\u2019ve signed a few. Their first choice midfield are: coutts, some bloke who isn\u2019t coutts, another bloke who isn\u2019t coutts, and another bloke who I\u2019ve never heard of but definitely isn\u2019t as good as coutts. By the way coutts is the best player in the championship and is highly rated by all SU fans. P.S. Coutts suffered a broken leg in a match against Burton literally ages ago but this doesn\u2019t stop SU fans constantly harping on about him. As an update, SU fans are currently petitioning the EFL to get Burton\u2019s villain of the piece banned for life despite the fact that said villain merely attempted to block coutts\u2019 shot and the referee didn\u2019t see the challenge as a foul never mind a booking."}

There\u2019s nothing at all ironic in this position despite the fact that they bought promotion from league 1 with the largest budget of all competing clubs and posted a thumping \u00a36 million loss last year.

Flecks\u2019 perfectly legitimate well timed tackle was deemed worthy of a red by the overly officious referee of their encounter with Bristol City. Korey Smith, the villain of the piece for successfully influencing the referee due to his theatrics, stupidly took things way too far by actually going off injured. Yes, he went off injured and the knuckle draggers still say he was a play acting wimp. Football is now played by pansies. BC went on to beat SU but only because Fleck was undeservedly sent off and BC got extremely lucky. BC definitely didn\u2019t deserve to win and Wilder definitely didn\u2019t **** things up with his tactics and substitutions. P.S. Wilder is God since achieving promotion from league 1 despite his hands being tied and forced to work miracles with the largest budget in the division."}
