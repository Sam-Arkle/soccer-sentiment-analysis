Genereal notes here for the project. Decisions made, things todo

The roys sitemap is probably a better place to visit in order to get to the prematch urls. 

Will be difficult to get the fan views as individuals, rather than a big blob prior to a given match. This may have an 
impact on sentiment analysis. 

Only looking at one team for 9 years, so only getting roughly 5000 comments, may not be enough




Future developments:
- Scrape from s24su to get the pre match sentiment from sufc fans. 
- Obvious issue for Roy's view: it is a cultivated list, it isn't necessarily representative of the general concensus.
- Get post match comments and see if that is useful (does pre-match sentiment indicate post-match? 
Could we get a measure of how pessimistic the fanbase is?)
- 


Comment scraping notes: 
Collecting URL for validation, team name and published date to match with the actual game, and comment. 
Could arguably not capture url but for now it is the safest bet. 
- Could store a comment per data entry or nest the comments on a per page basis. For now I'll go with 
one comment per data entry and we'll see if that bites us later. 
The number of pre-match comments is 9155, from 486 matches. 


FBref scraping notes:
Issues with rate limiting (429 responses). Potential solution is specify the agent. 

Successfully scrapping match urls, getting 531 matches. 

Match scrapping:
- Current plan is to amalgamate all the match stats? Or just collect Sheffiled united fouls, tackles, penalties?
I think just collect Sheffield united tackles fouls cards and penalties given. 

Note that these stats don't seem to exist for league one games. So should we ignore those or should 
we treat them seperately?

There is a rate limit of no more than ten requests a minute, which means that the delay should be at least 
six seconds.
