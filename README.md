Ongoing project started 26th February 2025.

Desiref stages:

- Scrape data of football statistics
- Clean data using Beautiful Soup
- Find an appropriate sentiment analysis tool (early candidates: Vader, TextBlob)
- Preprocess the data
- Analyse data to determine which predictive models are appropriate (avoiding just throwing the data at models and seeing what sticks)
- Visualize the results
